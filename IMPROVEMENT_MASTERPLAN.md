# Wombat Improvement Masterplan

## Overview
This masterplan outlines a phased approach to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability of the Wombat project. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with Phase 1 addressing critical issues that affect users directly.

## Phase 1: Critical Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
*Focus: Establish testing infrastructure and fix immediate quality issues*

### 1.1 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting with codecov.io or similar
- [ ] Add test targets to Taskfile.yml for running specific test suites
- [ ] Create testing guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Add example test patterns for common scenarios

### 1.2 Critical Component Tests
Priority order based on user impact:
- [ ] Add unit tests for `public/components/mongodb/` (database operations are critical)
- [ ] Add unit tests for `public/components/nats/` (messaging is core functionality)
- [ ] Add unit tests for `public/components/snowflake/` (data warehouse operations)
- [ ] Add unit tests for `public/components/gcp_bigtable/` (already has some tests, expand coverage)

### 1.3 Re-enable and Fix Linting
- [ ] Create a minimal `.golangci.yml` configuration that runs quickly
- [ ] Fix critical linting issues (error handling, nil checks, race conditions)
- [ ] Re-enable linting in CI pipeline with a 5-minute timeout
- [ ] Document linting exceptions where needed

### 1.4 Security Audit
- [ ] Enable `govulncheck` in CI pipeline
- [ ] Audit all credential handling code paths
- [ ] Add security testing for authentication components
- [ ] Create security policy (`SECURITY.md`)

## Phase 2: Documentation & API Stability (Weeks 5-8)
*Focus: Improve developer experience and API documentation*

### 2.1 Code Documentation
- [ ] Add godoc comments to all exported functions in `public/components/`
- [ ] Document complex algorithms and business logic
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for major design choices
- [ ] Add inline comments for non-obvious code sections

### 2.2 API Documentation
- [ ] Generate and publish godoc documentation
- [ ] Create component development guide
- [ ] Add code examples for each component
- [ ] Document configuration validation rules

### 2.3 Testing Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing guide
- [ ] Add integration test setup instructions
- [ ] Document test data requirements
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common test failures

## Phase 3: Performance & Reliability (Weeks 9-12)
*Focus: Ensure scalability and reliability under load*

### 3.1 Benchmark Suite
- [ ] Add benchmarks for critical data paths
- [ ] Create performance regression detection
- [ ] Document performance characteristics
- [ ] Add memory profiling for high-throughput components

### 3.2 Integration Test Suite
- [ ] Expand integration tests for all components
- [ ] Add chaos testing scenarios
- [ ] Create load testing suite
- [ ] Add end-to-end testing for common use cases

### 3.3 Error Handling Enhancement
- [ ] Implement structured logging throughout
- [ ] Add context to all errors
- [ ] Create error recovery strategies
- [ ] Document error handling patterns

## Phase 4: Developer Experience (Weeks 13-16)
*Focus: Make contributing easier and more efficient*

### 4.1 Development Tooling
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
- [ ] Create development container configuration
- [ ] Add VS Code workspace settings
- [ ] Create component scaffolding tool

### 4.2 CI/CD Enhancement
- [ ] Add parallel test execution
- [ ] Implement test result caching
- [ ] Add automated dependency updates
- [ ] Create preview deployments for PRs

### 4.3 Contributor Experience
- [ ] Create detailed contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add issue and PR templates
- [ ] Create "good first issue" labels
- [ ] Establish code review guidelines

## Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)
These can be implemented in parallel with Phase 1:

1. **Add a simple test template**
```go
// test_template.go
package template

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func TestComponent(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   interface{}
        want    interface{}
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid input",
            input:   "test",
            want:    "expected",
            wantErr: false,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := ProcessFunction(tt.input)
            if tt.wantErr {
                require.Error(t, err)
                return
            }
            require.NoError(t, err)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.want, got)
        })
    }
}
```

2. **Create minimal `.golangci.yml`**
```yaml
run:
  timeout: 5m
  skip-dirs:
    - vendor
    - testdata

linters:
  enable:
    - gofmt
    - govet
    - errcheck
    - staticcheck
    - ineffassign
    - typecheck
  disable:
    - unused # Re-enable after fixing issues

issues:
  max-same-issues: 0
  exclude-use-default: false
```

3. **Add code coverage to Taskfile.yml**
```yaml
test-coverage:
  desc: Run tests with coverage
  cmds:
    - go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
    - go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
    - echo "Coverage report generated at coverage.html"
```

## Success Metrics
- Test coverage > 70% for critical components
- All CI checks passing consistently
- Linting enabled with < 100 warnings
- 0 critical security vulnerabilities
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Median PR review time < 48 hours
- Build time < 10 minutes

## Resource Requirements
- 2-3 dedicated developers for 16 weeks
- CI/CD infrastructure costs (~$200/month)
- Code quality tooling (free for open source)
- Community involvement for testing and feedback

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Breaking changes**: Use feature flags for major changes
2. **Performance regression**: Benchmark before/after comparisons
3. **User disruption**: Maintain compatibility, deprecate gradually
4. **Contributor burnout**: Rotate responsibilities, recognize contributions

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create GitHub issues for each task
3. Assign Phase 1 tasks to team members
4. Set up weekly progress reviews
5. Communicate plan to community
