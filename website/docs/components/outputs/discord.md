Writes messages to a Discord channel.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  discord:
    channel_id: "" # No default (required)
    bot_token: "" # No default (required)
```

This output POSTs messages to the `/channels/{channel_id}/messages` Discord API endpoint authenticated as a bot using token based authentication.

If the format of a message is a JSON object matching the [Discord API message type](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#message-object) then it is sent directly, otherwise an object matching the API type is created with the content of the message added as a string.


## Fields

### `channel_id`

A discord channel ID to write messages to.


Type: `string`  

### `bot_token`

A bot token used for authentication.


Type: `string`
