Resources are components within Wombat that are declared with a unique label and can be referenced any number of times
within a configuration. Only one instance of each named resource is created, but it is safe to use it in multiple places
as they can be shared without consequence.

The following components can be defined as resources:

- inputs
- processors
- outputs
- caches
- rate limits

Some components such as [caches](/pipelines/build/cache) and [rate limits](/pipelines/build/rate_limit) can _only_ be
created as a resource. However, for components where it's optional there are a few reasons why it might be
advantageous to do so.

## How to use resources?
Resources are defined on the root level of the pipeline configuration file. Each resource is defined as a list under
a dedicated key that corresponds to the type of resource.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Input">
        ```yaml
        ## Using the resource
        input:
          resource: foo_input

        ## Defining the resource
        input_resources:
          - label: foo_input
            file:
              paths: [ ./in.txt ]
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Processor">
        ```yaml
        ## Using the resource
        pipeline:
          processors:
            - resource: foo_processor

        ## Defining the resource
        processor_resources:
          - label: foo_processor
            mapping: 'root = content.lowercase()'
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Output">
        ```yaml
        ## Using the resource
        output:
          resource: foo_output

        ## Defining the resource
        output_resources:
          - label: foo_output
            file:
                path: ./out.txt
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Cache">
        ```yaml
        ## Using the resource
        pipeline:
          processors:
            - cache:
                resource: foo_cache
                operator: set
                key: ${! json("id") }
                value: ${! content() }

        ## Defining the resource
        cache_resources:
          - label: foo_cache
            memory:
              default_ttl: 300s
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Rate Limit">
        ```yaml
        ## Using the resource
        pipeline:
          processors:
            - http_client:
                url: http://example.com
                verb: GET
                rate_limit: foo_rate_limit

        ## Defining the resource
        rate_limit_resources:
          - label: foo_rate_limit
            local:
              count: 10
              interval: 1s
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Why use resources?
Sometimes it's necessary to use a rather large component multiple times. Instead of copy/pasting the configuration or
using YAML anchors you can define your component as a resource.

In the following example we want to make an HTTP request with our payloads. Occasionally the payload might get rejected
due to garbage within its contents, and so we catch these rejected requests, attempt to "cleanse" the contents and try
to make the same HTTP request again. Since the HTTP request component is quite large (and likely to change over time) we
make sure to avoid duplicating it by defining it as a resource `get_foo`:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - resource: get_foo
    - catch:
        - mapping: |
            root = this
            root.content = this.content.strip_html()
        - resource: get_foo

processor_resources:
  - label: get_foo
    http:
      url: http://example.com/foo
      verb: POST
      headers:
        SomeThing: "set-to-this"
        SomeThingElse: "set-to-something-else"
```
