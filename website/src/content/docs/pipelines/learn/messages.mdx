In Wombat each message has raw contents and metadata, which is a map of key/value pairs representing an arbitrary amount
of complementary data.

### Payload
The payload of a message is the raw data that is being processed. At the lowest level, the payload is a byte array but
during processing, you have the ability to parse and manipulate the payload into a more structured form. For example,
if the actual data within the payload is JSON, you can address the payload in a structured form.

### Metadata
When an input protocol supports attributes or metadata they will automatically be added to your messages, refer to the
respective input documentation for a list of metadata keys. When an output supports attributes or metadata any metadata
key/value pairs in a message will be sent (subject to service limits).

        <Aside type="caution">
            There are two functions to reference metadata: `meta()` and `metadata()`. `meta()` has been
            depreciated in favor of `metadata()`.
        </Aside>

        Metadata values can be referenced in any field that supports [interpolation functions](./interpolation). For
        example, you can route messages to Kafka topics using interpolation of metadata keys:

        ```yaml
        output:
        kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topic: ${! metadata("target_topic") }
        ```

        Wombat also allows you to conditionally process messages based on their metadata with the [
        `switch` processor](/pipelines/reference/processors/switch):

        ```yaml
        pipeline:
        processors:
        - switch:
        - check: '@doc_type == "nested"'
        processors:
        - sql_insert:
        driver: mysql
        dsn: foouser:foopassword@tcp(localhost:3306)/foodb
        table: footable
        columns: [ foo, bar, baz ]
        args_mapping: |
        root = [
        this.document.foo,
        this.document.bar,
        @kafka_topic,
        ]
        ```

    <TabItem label="Editing">
        Wombat allows you to add and remove metadata using the [`mapping` processor](/pipelines/reference/processors/mapping). For example, you can
        do something like this in your pipeline:

        ```yaml
        pipeline:
        processors:
        - mapping: |
        # Remove all existing metadata from messages
        meta = deleted()

        # Add a new metadata field `time` from the contents of a JSON
        # field `event.timestamp`
        meta time = event.timestamp
        ```

        You can also use [Bloblang](/bloblang/) to delete individual metadata keys with:

        ```coffee
        meta foo = deleted()
        ```

        Or do more interesting things like remove all metadata keys with a certain prefix:

        ```coffee
        meta = @.filter(kv -> !kv.key.has_prefix("kafka_"))
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Restricting">
        Outputs that support metadata, headers or some other variant of enriched fields on messages will attempt to send all
        metadata key/value pairs by default. However, sometimes it's useful to refer to metadata fields at the output level even
        though we do not wish to send them with our data. In this case it's possible to restrict the metadata keys that are sent
        with the field `metadata.exclude_prefixes` within the respective output config.

        For example, if we were sending messages to kafka using a metadata key `target_topic` to determine the topic but we
        wished to prevent that metadata key from being sent as a header we could use the following configuration:

        ```yaml
        output:
        kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topic: ${! metadata("target_topic") }
        metadata:
        exclude_prefixes:
        - target_topic
        ```

        And when the list of metadata keys that we do _not_ want to send is large it can be helpful to use
        a [Bloblang mapping](/bloblang/) in order to give all of these "private" keys a common prefix:

        ```yaml
        pipeline:
        processors:
        # Has an explicit list of public metadata keys, and everything else is given
        # an underscore prefix.
        - mapping: |
        let allowed_meta = [
        "foo",
        "bar",
        "baz",
        ]
        meta = @.map_each_key(key -> if !$allowed_meta.contains(key) {
        "_" + key
    })

        output:
        kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topic: ${! metadata("_target_topic") }
        metadata:
        exclude_prefixes: [ "_" ]
        ```
