<Aside type="caution">
    Since buffers are able to modify (or disable) the transaction model within Wombat it is important that when you choose a
    buffer you read its documentation to understand the implication it will have on delivery guarantees.
</Aside>

Wombat uses a transaction model internally for guaranteeing delivery of messages, this means that a message from an
input is not acknowledged (or its offset committed, etc) until that message has been processed and either intentionally
deleted or successfully delivered to all outputs. This transaction model makes Wombat safe to deploy in scenarios where
data loss is unacceptable. However, sometimes it's useful to customize the way in which messages are delivered, and this
is where buffers come in.

A buffer is an optional component type that comes immediately after the input layer and can be used as a way of
decoupling the transaction model from components downstream such as the processing layer and outputs. This is considered
an advanced component as most users will likely not benefit from a buffer, but they enable you to do things like group
messages using window algorithms or intentionally weaken the delivery guarantees of the pipeline depending on the buffer
you choose.

## Metrics
The following metrics are exposed for a buffer:

- `buffer_received`: A count of the number of messages written to the buffer.
- `buffer_batch_received`: A count of the number of message batches written to the buffer.
- `buffer_sent`: A count of the number of messages read from the buffer.
- `buffer_batch_sent`: A count of the number of message batches read from the buffer.
- `buffer_latency_ns`: Measures the roundtrip latency in nanoseconds from the point at which a message is read from the
buffer up to the moment it has been acknowledged by the output.
- `batch_created`: A count of each time a buffer-level batch has been created using a batching policy. Includes a label
`mechanism` describing the particular mechanism that triggered it, one of; `count`, `size`, `period`, `check`.
