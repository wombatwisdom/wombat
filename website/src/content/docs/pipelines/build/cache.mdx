<Aside type="note">
    A cache is defined as a **resource** which can be used by other components.
    Find out more about resources [in this document.](/pipelines/learn/resources)
</Aside>

A cache is a key/value store which can be used by certain components for applications such as deduplication or data
joins. Caches are configured as a named resource:

```yaml
cache_resources:
  - label: foobar
    memcached:
      addresses:
        - localhost:11211
      default_ttl: 60s
```

<Aside type="tip">
It's possible to layer caches with read-through and write-through behaviour using the `multilevel` cache.
</Aside>

And then any components that use caches have a field `resource` that specifies the cache resource:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - cache:
        resource: foobar
        operator: add
        key: '${! json("message.id") }'
        value: "storeme"
    - mapping: root = if errored() { deleted() }
```

For the simple case where you wish to store messages in a cache as an output destination for your pipeline check out
the [`cache` output](/reference/components/outputs/cache). To see examples of more advanced uses of caches such as
hydration and deduplication check out the [`cache` processor](/reference/components/processors/cache).

## Metrics
The following metrics are exposed for a cache:

All cache metrics have a label `operation` denoting the operation that triggered the metric series, one of; `add`,
`get`, `set` or `delete`.

- `cache_success`: A count of the number of successful cache operations.
- `cache_error`: A count of the number of cache operations that resulted in an error.
- `cache_latency_ns`: Latency of operations in nanoseconds.
- `cache_not_found`: A count of the number of get operations that yielded no value due to the item not being found. This
count is separate from `cache_error`.
- `cache_duplicate`: A count of the number of add operations that were aborted due to the key already existing. This
count is separate from `cache_error`.
