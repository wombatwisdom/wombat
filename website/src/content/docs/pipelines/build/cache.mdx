A cache is a key/value store which can be used by certain components for applications such as deduplication or data
joins. Caches are configured as a named resource:

```yaml
cache_resources:
  - label: foobar
    memcached:
      addresses:
        - localhost:11211
      default_ttl: 60s
```

<Aside type="tip">
It's possible to layer caches with read-through and write-through behaviour using the `multilevel` cache.
</Aside>

And then any components that use caches have a field `resource` that specifies the cache resource:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - cache:
        resource: foobar
        operator: add
        key: '${! json("message.id") }'
        value: "storeme"
    - mapping: root = if errored() { deleted() }
```

For the simple case where you wish to store messages in a cache as an output destination for your pipeline check out
the `cache` output. To see examples of more advanced uses of caches such as hydration and deduplication
check out the `cache` processor.
