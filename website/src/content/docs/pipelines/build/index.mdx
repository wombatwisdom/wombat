Writing configurations isn't difficult at all. We even provide a generator for you to get started quickly:

```shell
wombat create -s stdin/mapping/stdout > my_pipeline.yaml
```

Running this command will create a new pipeline configuration file called `my_pipeline.yaml` that reads from `stdin`,
applies a simple mapping processor, and writes to `stdout`.

```shell
input:
  stdin:
    scanner:
      lines: {}
    auto_replay_nacks: true
buffer:
  none: {}
pipeline:
  threads: -1
  processors:
    - mapping: "" # No default (required)
output:
  stdout:
    codec: lines
```

How brilliant is that!? You can now run your pipeline with:

```shell
wombat -c my_pipeline.yaml
```

Everything you type into the terminal will be processed by Wombat and written back to the terminal. Obviously our job
is done now and we can relish in the glory of our creation.

## Structure

But just in case you are still hungry for more, here is a more detailed explanation of the configuration file. The
configuration structure is made up of a number of root sections:

    - Core Components
    - Observability Components
    - Resource Components

Each of these sections can contain a number of components that are used to define the behaviour of the pipeline.

### Core Components

Every Wombat pipeline has at least one [input](input), an optional [buffer](buffer), an [output](output) and any
number of [processors](processors):

```yaml
input:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ TODO ]
    topics: [ foo, bar ]
    consumer_group: foogroup

buffer:
  type: none

pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        message = this
        meta.link_count = links.length()

output:
  aws_s3:
    bucket: TODO
    path: '${! metadata("kafka_topic") }/${! json("message.id") }.json'
```

These are the main components within Wombat and they provide the majority of useful behaviour.

### Resource Components

Finally, there are [caches](cache) and [rate limits](rate_limit). These are components that are referenced by core
components and can be shared.

```yaml
input:
  http_client: # This is an input
    url: TODO
    rate_limit: foo_ratelimit # This is a reference to a rate limit

pipeline:
  processors:
    - cache: # This is a processor
        resource: baz_cache # This is a reference to a cache
        operator: add
        key: '${! json("id") }'
        value: "x"
    - mapping: root = if errored() { deleted() }

rate_limit_resources:
  - label: foo_ratelimit
    local:
      count: 500
      interval: 1s

cache_resources:
  - label: baz_cache
    memcached:
      addresses: [ localhost:11211 ]
```

It's also possible to configure inputs, outputs and processors as resources which allows them to be reused throughout a
configuration with the `resource` input, `resource` output and `resource` processor respectively.

### Observability Components

There are also the observability components [http](/pipelines/observe/http), [logger](/pipelines/observe/logger), [metrics](/pipelines/observe/metrics), and [tracing](/pipelines/observe/tracers),
which allow you to specify how Wombat exposes observability data:

```yaml
http:
  address: 0.0.0.0:4195
  enabled: true
  debug_endpoints: false

logger:
  format: json
  level: WARN

metrics:
  statsd:
    address: localhost:8125
    flush_period: 100ms

tracer:
  jaeger:
    agent_address: localhost:6831
```
