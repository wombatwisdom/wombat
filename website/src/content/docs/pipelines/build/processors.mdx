Wombat processors are functions applied to messages passing through a pipeline. The function signature allows a
processor to mutate or drop messages depending on the content of the message. There are many types on offer but the most
powerful are the `mapping` and `mutation` processors.

Depending on where in the config they are placed they will be run either immediately
after a specific input (set in the input section), on all messages (set in the pipeline section) or before a specific
output (set in the output section). Most processors apply to all messages and can be placed in the pipeline section:
