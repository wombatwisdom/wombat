    A rate limit is defined as a **resource** which can be used by other components.

A rate limit is a strategy for limiting the usage of a shared resource across parallel components in a Wombat instance,
or potentially across multiple instances. They are configured as a resource:

```yaml
rate_limit_resources:
  - label: foobar
    local:
      count: 500
      interval: 1s
```

And most components that hit external services have a field `rate_limit` for specifying a rate limit resource to use,
identified by the `label` field. For example, if we wanted to use our `foobar` rate limit with an
[`http_client` input](/reference/components/inputs/http_client) it would look like this:

```yaml
input:
  http_client:
    url: TODO
    verb: GET
    rate_limit: foobar
```

By using a rate limit in this way we can guarantee that our input will only poll our HTTP source at the rate of 500
requests per second.

Some components don't have a `rate_limit` field but we might still wish to throttle them by a rate limit, in which case
we can use the [`rate_limit` processor](/reference/components/processor/rate_limit) that applies back pressure to a
processing pipeline when the limit is reached. For example, if we wished to limit the consumption of lines of a
[`csv` input](/reference/components/inputs/csv) to a specified rate limit we can do that with the following:

```yaml
input:
  csv:
    paths:
      - ./foo.csv
  processors:
    - rate_limit:
        resource: foobar
```

## Metrics
The following metrics are exposed for a rate limit:

- `rate_limit_checked`: A count of the number of times the rate limit has been probed.
- `rate_limit_triggered`: A count of the number of times the rate limit has been triggered by a probe.
- `rate_limit_error`: A count of the number of times the rate limit has errored when probed.
