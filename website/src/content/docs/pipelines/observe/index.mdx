Anyone who ever ran something in production will tell you that the job is not done once the pipeline is running. You
need to monitor it, trace it, and make sure it's healthy. This section will explain how to do that with Wombat.

## HTTP Health Checks
Wombat serves two HTTP endpoints for health checks:

- `/ping` can be used as a liveness probe as it always returns a 200.
- `/read` can be used as a readiness probe as it serves a 200 only when both the input and output are connected, otherwise a 503 is returned.

The [http section](http) of the configuration file can be used to configure the health check endpoints as well as the
http server itself.

## Logging
Logging in wombat can be customized to your needs in the [logging section](logging) of the configuration file.
By default Wombat logs to stdout and stderr, but it's possible to configure it to log to a file.

## Metrics
Wombat [exposes lots of metrics](metrics#metric-names) either to Statsd, Prometheus, Cloudwatch or for debugging
purposes an HTTP endpoint that returns a JSON formatted object.

The target destination of Wombat metrics is configurable from the [metrics section](metrics), where it's also possible
to rename and restrict the metrics that are emitted with mappings.

## Tracing
Wombat also [emits opentracing events](tracers) to a tracer of your choice, which can be used to visualise the
processors within a pipeline.
