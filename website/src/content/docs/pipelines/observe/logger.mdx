Wombat logging prints to stdout (or stderr if your output is stdout) and is formatted
as [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) by default. Use these configuration options to change both the logging formats
as well as the destination of logs.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Logfmt to Stdout">
```yaml
logger:
  level: INFO
  format: logfmt
  add_timestamp: false
  static_fields:
    '@service': wombat
```
  </TabItem>
  <tab label="JSON to File">
```yaml
logger:
  level: WARN
  format: json
  file:
    path: ./logs/wombat.ndjson
    rotate: true
```
  </tab>
