## Inline
Tests can be written as part of the pipeline configuration file itself by providing a `tests` field at the root of the
config. This field should contain a list of test definitions, each of which should have a unique `name` field.

## Separate Files
However, it is more common to write tests in separate files that accompany the configuration file being tested. These
files should have the same name as the configuration file but with a `_wombat_test` suffix. For example, if you have a
config file `foo.yaml` you would write your tests in a file named `foo_wombat_test.yaml`. Each of these files should
have a `tests` field at the root that contains a list of test definitions.

## Fragmented
A last option is to write fragmented tests across multiple files, in which case you must provide a `target_processors`
field that points to the processor(s) being tested. This field should be a full
[JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) that points to the processor(s) within the configuration
file. This is particularly useful when you have a large number of tests to write for a single configuration file. Each
of these test files should have a `tests` field at the root that contains a list of test definitions.
