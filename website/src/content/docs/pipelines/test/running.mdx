Executing tests for a specific config can be done by pointing the subcommand `test` at either the config to be tested or
its test definition, e.g. `wombat test ./config.yaml` and `wombat test ./config_wombat_test.yaml` are equivalent.

The `test` subcommand also supports wildcard patterns e.g. `wombat test ./foo/*.yaml` will execute all tests within
matching files. In order to walk a directory tree and execute all tests found you can use the shortcut `./...`, e.g.
`wombat test ./...` will execute all tests found in the current directory, any child directories, and so on.

If you want to allow components to write logs at a provided level to stdout when running the tests, you can use
`wombat test --log <level>`. Please consult the [logger docs](/reference/configuration/logger) for further details.
