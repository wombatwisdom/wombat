[Debugging](/pipelines/debug) is one thing, but how do you ensure that your configuration is working as expected? Wombat
provides offers the ability to write unit tests for your configuration files. It makes it easy to protect your pipeline
configurations from regressions over time. And honestly, who doesn't like green ticks?

So how hard can it be to write a test? Not hard at all! A test is defined as a YAML object with a few key fields. Just
follow this 5 step plan to internal peace and equilibrium:

<Steps>
    1. Decide where to [store](storing) your tests
    2. Create a test definition with a unique `name` field:
        ```yaml
        tests:
          - name: test name
        ```
    3. Define some input data:
        ```yaml
        tests:
          - name: test name
            input_batch:
              - content: 'example content'
        ```
    4. Add output conditions to test:
        ```yaml
        tests:
          - name: test name
            input_batch:
              - content: 'example content'
            output_batches:
              - - content_equals: 'example content'
        ```
    5. [Run](running) the test with `wombat test your_test_file.yaml`
</Steps>
