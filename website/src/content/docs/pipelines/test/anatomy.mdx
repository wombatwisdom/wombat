No matter which way you choose to write your tests, the `tests` field should contain a list of test definitions, each
with their own unique `name` field. Each test is run in complete isolation, including any resources defined by the
config file.

<Aside type="tip">
    Find out more about the details of each field in the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/unit_testing).

## Input Data
The `input_batch` field lists one or more messages to be fed into the targeted processors as a batch. Each message of
the batch may have its raw content defined as well as metadata key/value pairs.

## Output Conditions
Having only an input batch is quite useless without any output conditions to test against. The `output_batches` field
lists any number of batches of messages which are expected to result from the target processors. Each batch lists any
number of messages, each one defining conditions to describe the expected contents of the message.

If the number of batches defined does not match the resulting number of batches the test will fail. If the number of
messages defined in each batch does not match the number in the resulting batches the test will fail. If any condition
of a message fails then the test fails.

## Target Processors
The optional `target_processors` field is either the label of a processor to test, or a
[JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) that identifies the position of a processor, or list of
processors, within the file which should be executed by the test. For example a value of `foo` would target a processor
with the label `foo`, and a value of `/input/processors` would target all processors within the input section of the
config.

## Environment Variables
Since it is quite common to use environment variables in your configuration files, the `environment` field allows you to
define an object of key/value pairs that set environment variables to be evaluated during the parsing of the target
config file. These are unique to each test, allowing you to test different environment variable interpolation.

## Mocking Processors

<Aside type="danger">
    This feature is currently in a BETA phase, which means breaking changes could be made if a fundamental issue with
    the feature is found.
</Aside>

Sometimes you'll want to write tests for a series of processors, where one or more of them are networked (or otherwise
stateful). Rather than creating and managing mocked services you can define mock versions of those processors in the
test definition. For example, if we have a config with the following processors:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: 'root = "simon says: " + content()'
    - label: get_foobar_api
      http:
        url: http://example.com/foobar
        verb: GET
    - mapping: 'root = content().uppercase()'
```

Rather than create a fake service for the [`http` processor](/references/components/processors/http) to interact with we can define a mock in our test definition
that replaces it with a [`mapping` processor](/reference/components/processors/mapping). Mocks are configured as a map of labels that identify
a processor to replace and the config to replace it with:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: mocks the http proc
    target_processors: '/pipeline/processors'
    mocks:
      get_foobar_api:
        mapping: 'root = content().string() + " this is some mock content"'
    input_batch:
      - content: "hello world"
    output_batches:
      - - content_equals: "SIMON SAYS: HELLO WORLD THIS IS SOME MOCK CONTENT"
```

With the above test definition the `http` processor will be swapped out for
`mapping: 'root = content().string() + " this is some mock content"'`. For the purposes of mocking it is recommended
that you use a [`mapping` processor](/reference/components/processors/mapping) that simply mutates the message in a way that you would expect
the mocked processor to.

<Aside type="caution">
    It's not currently possible to mock components that are imported as separate resource files (using `--resource`/
    `-r`). It is recommended that you mock these by maintaining separate definitions for test purposes (
    `-r "./test/*.yaml"`).
</Aside>

### More granular mocking
It is also possible to target specific fields within the test config by [JSON pointers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) as an alternative
to labels. The following test definition would create the same mock as the previous:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: mocks the http proc
    target_processors: '/pipeline/processors'
    mocks:
      /pipeline/processors/1:
        mapping: 'root = content().string() + " this is some mock content"'
    input_batch:
      - content: "hello world"
    output_batches:
      - - content_equals: "SIMON SAYS: HELLO WORLD THIS IS SOME MOCK CONTENT"
```
