Once you have a config written you now move onto the next headache of proving that it works, and understanding why it
doesn't. Wombat, like most good config driven services, performs validation on configs and tries to provide sensible
error messages.

However, with validation it can be hard to capture all problems, and the user usually understands their intentions
better than the service. In order to help expose and diagnose config errors Wombat provides two mechanisms;
[linting](linting) and [echoing](echoing).
