title: Echoing
---
Echoing is where Wombat can print back your configuration _after_ it has been parsed. It is done with the `echo`
subcommand, which is able to show you a normalised version of your config, allowing you to see how it was interpreted:

```shell
wombat -c ./your-config.yaml echo
```

You can check the output of the above command to see if certain sections are missing or fields are incorrect, which
allows you to pinpoint typos in the config.
