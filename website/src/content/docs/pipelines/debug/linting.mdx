title: Linting

If you attempt to run a config that has linting errors Wombat will print the errors and halt execution. If, however, you
want to test your configs before deployment you can do so with the `lint` subcommand:

For example, imagine we have a config `foo.yaml`, where we intend to read from AMQP, but there is a typo in our config
struct:

```yaml
input:
  amqp_0_9:
    yourl: amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmqserver:5672/
```

We can catch this error before attempting to run the config:

```shell
$ wombat lint ./foo.yaml
./foo.yaml: line 3: field yourl not recognised
```

For more information read the output from `wombat lint --help`.
