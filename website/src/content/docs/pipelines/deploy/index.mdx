While there are cases where you might want to run Wombat as a tool to get a specific job done, the whole idea behind
a streaming pipeline would be to deploy it in a production worthy context. This section will explain a few of the
options for deploying your Wombat pipeline.

## Operating Modes
### Simple Mode
The default mode of running Wombat is the simplest way to deploy your pipeline. Chances are you've already done
this as part of running through these docs. It basically comes down to running the following command:

```shell
wombat run -c ./pipeline.yaml
```

Or if you are more docker minded, you might want to run it in a container:

```shell
docker run -v $(pwd)/pipeline.yaml:/pipeline.yaml ghcr.io/wombatwisdom/wombat:latest
```

### Streams Mode
Sometimes you might want provide others with a way to run their own pipelines. In this case you might be interested
in running Wombat in Streams mode.

```shell
wombat -r "./prod/*.yaml" -c ./config.yaml streams
```

Running Wombat in streams mode will expose a ReST API which allows you to dynamically create, read the status of,
update, and delete streams at runtime.

## Deployment Targets

### Cloud
Running Wombat in the cloud is a great way to ensure that your pipeline is always available. We currently support
running Wombat in [AWS](cloud/aws.mdx) and [GCP](cloud/gcp.mdx) but it should be fairly easy to run it in other
cloud environments as well.
