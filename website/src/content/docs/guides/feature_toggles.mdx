Resources can be imported separately to your config file with the cli flag `-r` or `-resources`, which is a useful way
to switch out resources with common names based on your chosen environment. For example, with a main configuration file
`config.yaml`:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - resource: get_foo
```

And then two resource files, one stored at the path `./staging/request.yaml`:

```yaml
processor_resources:
  - label: get_foo
    http:
      url: http://example.com/foo
      verb: POST
      headers:
        SomeThing: "set-to-this"
        SomeThingElse: "set-to-something-else"
```

And another stored at the path `./production/request.yaml`:

```yaml
processor_resources:
  - label: get_foo
    http:
      url: http://example.com/bar
      verb: PUT
      headers:
        Desires: "are-empty"
```

We can select our chosen resource by changing which file we import, either running:

```shell
wombat -r ./staging/request.yaml -c ./config.yaml
```

Or:

```shell
wombat -r ./production/request.yaml -c ./config.yaml
```

These flags also support wildcards, which allows you to import an entire directory of resource files like
`wombat -r "./staging/*.yaml" -c ./config.yaml`. You can find out more about configuration resources in
the [resources document](/pipelines/learn/resources).
