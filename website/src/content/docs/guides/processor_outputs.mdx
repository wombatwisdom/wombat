title: Processors as outputs
---
It might be the case that a processor that results in a side effect, such as the `sql_insert`
or `redis` processors, is the only side effect of a pipeline, and therefore could be considered the
output.

In such cases it's possible to place these processors within a `reject` output so that they behave the
same as regular outputs, where success results in dropping the message with an acknowledgement and failure results in a
nack (or retry):

```yaml
output:
  reject: 'failed to send data: ${! error() }'
  processors:
    - try:
        - redis:
            url: tcp://localhost:6379
            command: sadd
            args_mapping: 'root = [ this.key, this.value ]'
        - mapping: root = deleted()
```

The way this works is that if your processor with the side effect (`redis` in this case) succeeds then the final
`mapping` processor deletes the message which results in an acknowledgement. If the processor fails then the `try` block
exits early without executing the `mapping` processor and instead the message is routed to the `reject` output, which
nacks the message with an error message containing the error obtained from the `redis` processor.
