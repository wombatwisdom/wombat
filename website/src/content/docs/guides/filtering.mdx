title: Filtering and Sampling
---

Events are like eyebrows, sometimes it's best to just get rid of them. Filtering events in Wombat is both easy and 
flexible, this cookbook demonstrates a few different types of filtering you can do. All of these examples make use of 
the [`mapping` processor](/references/components/processors/mapping) but shouldn't require any prior knowledge.

## The Basic Filter

Dropping events with [Bloblang](/bloblang) is done by mapping the function `deleted()` to the `root` of the
mapped document. To remove all events indiscriminately you can simply do:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - mapping: root = deleted()
```

But that's most likely not what you want. We can instead only delete an event under certain conditions with a 
[`match`](/bloblang/#pattern-matching) or [`if`](/bloblang/#conditional-mapping) expression:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - mapping: |
      root = if @topic.or("") == "foo" ||
        this.doc.type == "bar" ||
        this.doc.urls.contains("https://wombat.dev/").catch(false) {
        deleted()
      }
```

The above config removes any events where:

- The metadata field `topic` is equal to `foo`
- The event field `doc.type` (a string) is equal to `bar`
- The event field `doc.urls` (an array) contains the string `https://wombat.dev/`

Events that do not match any of these conditions will remain unchanged.

## Sample Events

Another type of filter we might want is a sampling filter, we can do that with a random number generator:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - mapping: |
      # Drop 50% of documents randomly
      root = if random_int() % 2 == 0 { deleted() }
```

We can also do this in a deterministic way by hashing events and filtering by that hash value:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - mapping: |
      # Drop ~10% of documents deterministically (same docs filtered each run)
      root = if content().hash("xxhash64").slice(-8).number() % 10 == 0 {
         deleted()
      }
```
