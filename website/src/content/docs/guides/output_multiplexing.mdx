title: Output Multiplexing
---
There are a few different ways of multiplexing in Wombat, here's a quick run through:

## Interpolation Multiplexing

Some output fields support [field interpolation][interpolation], which is a super easy way to multiplex messages based
on their contents in situations where you are multiplexing to the same service.

For example, multiplexing against Kafka topics is a common pattern:

```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ TODO:6379 ]
    topic: ${! metadata("target_topic") }
```

Refer to the field documentation for a given output to see if it support interpolation.

## Switch Multiplexing

A more advanced form of multiplexing is to route messages to different output configurations based on a query. This is
easy with the `switch` output:

```yaml
output:
  switch:
    cases:
      - check: this.type == "foo"
        output:
          amqp_1:
            urls: [ amqps://guest:guest@localhost:5672/ ]
            target_address: queue:/the_foos

      - check: this.type == "bar"
        output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: dealing_with_mike
            topic: mikes_bars

      - output:
          redis_streams:
            url: tcp://localhost:6379
            stream: everything_else
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                root = this
                root.type = this.type.not_null() | "unknown"
```
