It's possible to create fallback outputs for when an output target fails using a [`fallback` output](/reference/components/outputs/fallback):

```yaml
output:
  fallback:
    - aws_sqs:
        url: https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/TODO/TODO
        max_in_flight: 20

    - http_client:
        url: http://backup:1234/dlq
        verb: POST
```
