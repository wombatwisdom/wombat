Wombat logging prints to stdout (or stderr if your output is stdout) and is formatted
as [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) by default. Use these configuration options to change both the logging formats
as well as the destination of logs.

| `add_timestamp` | bool | No | `false` | Whether to include timestamps in logs. |
| `level_name` | string | No | `"level"` | The name of the level field added to logs when the `format` is `json`. |
| `timestamp_name` | string | No | `"time"` | The name of the timestamp field added to logs when `add_timestamp` is set to `true` and the `format` is `json`. |
| `message_name` | string | No | `"msg"` | The name of the message field added to logs when the `format` is `json`. |
| `static_fields` | map of `string` | No | `{"@service":"wombat"}` | A map of key/value pairs to add to each structured log. |
