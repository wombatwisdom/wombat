title: Scanners
---

For most Wombat [inputs](cmp-inputs.mdx) the data consumed comes pre-partitioned into discrete messages which can be
comfortably held and processed in memory. However, some inputs such as the `file` input often need to
consume data that is large enough that it cannot be processed entirely within memory, and others such as the 
`socket` input don't have a concept of consuming the data "entirely".

For such inputs it's necessary to define a mechanism by which the stream of source bytes can be chopped into smaller
logical messages, processed and outputted as a continuous process whilst the stream is being read, as this dramatically
reduces the memory usage of Wombat as a whole and results in a more fluid flow of data.

The way in which we define this chopping mechanism is through scanners, configured as a field on each input that
requires one. For example, if we wished to consume files line-by-line, which each individual line being processed as a
discrete message, we could use the `lines` scanner with our `file` input:

<tabs>
    <tab title="Common" active="true">
        <code-block lang="yaml">
input:
  file:
    paths: [ "./*.txt" ]
    scanner:
      lines: { }
        </code-block>
    </tab>
    <tab title="Advanced">
        <code-block lang="yaml">
# Instead of newlines, use a custom delimiter:
input:
  file:
    paths: [ "./*.txt" ]
    scanner:
      lines:
        custom_delimiter: "---END---"
        max_buffer_size: 100_000_000 # 100MB line buffer
        </code-block>
    </tab>
</tabs>

A scanner is a plugin similar to any other core Wombat component (inputs, processors, outputs, etc), which means it's
possible to define your own scanners that can be utilised by inputs that need them.
