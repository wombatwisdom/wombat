title: Health API
---

The Health API serves two endpoints to check the state of a Wombat process. These endpoints can be used as liveness
and readiness probes in Kubernetes or other orchestration systems.

## API

### GET `/ping`
Always returns a 200 OK response. This can be used as a liveness probe to make sure Wombat is running.

### GET `/ready`
Returns 200 only when both the input and output are connected and the pipeline is ready to process messages.
Otherwise, a 503 response is returned.
