## Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- gcs_bucket
- gcs_last_modified
- gcs_last_modified_unix
- gcs_content_type
- gcs_content_encoding
- All user defined metadata
```

You can access these metadata fields using function interpolation.

### Credentials

## Fields

### `bucket`

The name of the bucket from which to download objects.

<Aside type="caution" title="Sensitive Information">

### `delete_objects`

Whether to delete downloaded objects from the bucket once they are processed.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
