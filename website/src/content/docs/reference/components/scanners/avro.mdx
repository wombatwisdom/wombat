## Avro JSON format

This scanner yields documents formatted as [Avro JSON](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding) when decoding with Avro schemas. In this format the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- if its type is `null`, then it is encoded as a JSON `null`;
- otherwise it is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair whose name is the type's name and whose value is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum) the user-specified name is used, for other types the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Foo"]`, where `Foo` is a record name, would encode:

- `null` as `null`;
- the string `"a"` as `{"string": "a"}`; and
- a `Foo` instance as `{"Foo": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Foo` instance.

However, it is possible to instead create documents in [standard/raw JSON format](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull) by setting the field `avro_raw_json` to `true`.


## Fields

### `raw_json`

Whether messages should be decoded into normal JSON ("json that meets the expectations of regular internet json") rather than [Avro JSON](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding). If `true` the schema returned from the subject should be decoded as [standard json](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull) instead of as [avro json](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodec). There is a [comment in goavro](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/blob/5ec5a5ee7ec82e16e6e2b438d610e1cab2588393/union.go#L224-L249), the [underlining library used for avro serialization](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro), that explains in more detail the difference between the standard json and avro json.
