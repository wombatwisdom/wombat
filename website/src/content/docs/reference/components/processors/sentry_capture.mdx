  extras: root.foo = "bar" # No default (optional)
  tags: {} # No default (optional)

## Fields

### `dsn`

The DSN address to send sentry events to. If left empty, then SENTRY_DSN is used.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `message`

A message to set on the sentry event
This field supports interpolation functions.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

message: webhook event received

message: 'failed to find product in database: ${! error() }'
```

### `context`

A mapping that must evaluate to an object-of-objects or `deleted()`. If this mapping produces a value, then it is set on a sentry event as additional context.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

context: 'root = {"order": {"product_id": "P93174", "quantity": 5}}'

context: root = deleted()
```

### `extras`

A mapping that must evaluate to an object. If this mapping produces a value, then it is set on a sentry event as extras.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

extras: root.foo = "bar"

extras: root = this.without("password")
```

### `tags`

Sets key/value string tags on an event. Unlike context, these are indexed and searchable on Sentry but have length limitations.
This field supports interpolation functions.


*Type*: `object`


### `environment`

The environment to be sent with events. If left empty, then SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT is used.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `release`

The version of the code deployed to an environment. If left empty, then the Sentry client will attempt to detect the release from the environment.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `level`

Sets the level on sentry events similar to logging levels.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"INFO"`

Options:
`DEBUG`
, `INFO`
, `WARN`
, `ERROR`
, `FATAL`
.

### `transport_mode`

Determines how events are sent. A sync transport will block when sending each event until a response is received from the Sentry server. The recommended async transport will enqueue events in a buffer and send them in the background.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"async"`

Options:
`async`
, `sync`
.

### `flush_timeout`

The duration to wait when closing the processor to flush any remaining enqueued events.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"5s"`

### `sampling_rate`

The rate at which events are sent to the server. A value of 0 disables capturing sentry events entirely. A value of 1 results in sending all events to Sentry. Any value in between results sending some percentage of events.


*Type*: `float`

*Default*: `1`
