This output can send message to Timeplus Enterprise Cloud, Timeplus Enterprise (self-hosted) or directly to timeplusd.

This output accepts structured message only. It also expects all message contains the same keys and matches the schema of the destination stream. If the upstream source or pipeline returns
unstructured message such as string, please refer to the "Unstructured message" example.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="To Timeplus Enterprise Cloud">
You will need to create API Key on Timeplus Enterprise Cloud Web console first and then set the `apikey` field.

```
yaml
output:
  timeplus:
    workspace: my_workspace_id
    stream: mystream
    apikey: <Your API Key>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="To Timeplus Enterprise (self-hosted)">
For self-housted Timeplus Enterprise, you will need to specify the username and password as well as the URL of the App server

```
yaml
output:
  timeplus:
    url: http://localhost:8000
    workspace: my_workspace_id
    stream: mystream
    username: username
    password: pw
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="To Timeplusd">
This output writes to Timeplusd via HTTP so make sure you specify the HTTP port of the Timeplusd.

```
yaml
output:
  timeplus:
    url: http://localhost:3218
    stream: mystream
    username: username
    password: pw
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Unstructured message">
If the upstream source or pipeline returns unstructured message such as string, you can leverage the output processors to wrap it into a stucture message and then pass it to the output. This example create a strcutre mesasge with `raw` field and store the original string content into this field. You can modify the name of this `raw` field to whatever you want. Please make sure the destiation stream contains such field

```
yaml
output:
  timeplus:
    workspace: my_workspace_id
    stream: mystream
    apikey: <Api key genereated on web console>

  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = {}
        root.raw = content().string()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Fields

### `target`

The destination type, either Timeplus Enterprise or timeplusd


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"timeplus"`

Options:
`timeplus`
, `timeplusd`
.

### `url`

The url should always include schema and host.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"https://us-west-2.timeplus.cloud"`

```yml
# Examples

url: http://localhost:8000

url: http://127.0.0.1:3218
```

### `workspace`

ID of the workspace. Required if target is `timeplus`.


*Type*: `string`


### `stream`

The name of the stream. Make sure the schema of the stream matches the input


*Type*: `string`


### `apikey`

The API key. Required if you are sending message to Timeplus Enterprise Cloud

	This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our secrets page for more info.
</Aside>



*Type*: `string`


### `username`

The username. Required if you are sending message to Timeplus Enterprise (self-hosted) or timeplusd


*Type*: `string`


### `password`

The password. Required if you are sending message to Timeplus Enterprise (self-hosted) or timeplusd
<Aside type="caution" title="Sensitive Information">
	This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our secrets page for more info.
</Aside>



*Type*: `string`


### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a batching policy.


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.check`

A Bloblang query that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of processors to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```
