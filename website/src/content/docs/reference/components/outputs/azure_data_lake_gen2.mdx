Sends message parts as files to an Azure Data Lake Gen2 filesystem. Each file is uploaded with the filename specified with the `path` field.

Introduced in version 4.38.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  azure_data_lake_gen2:
    storage_account: ""
    storage_access_key: ""
    storage_connection_string: ""
    storage_sas_token: ""
    filesystem: messages-${!timestamp("2006")} # No default (required)
    path: ${!counter()}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt
    max_in_flight: 64
```

In order to have a different path for each file you should use function
interpolations described here, which are
calculated per message of a batch.

Supports multiple authentication methods but only one of the following is required:

- `storage_connection_string`
- `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`
- `storage_account` and `storage_sas_token`
- `storage_account` to access via [DefaultAzureCredential](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential)

If multiple are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

If the `storage_connection_string` does not contain the `AccountName` parameter, please specify it in the
`storage_account` field.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `storage_account`

The storage account to access. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `storage_access_key`

The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `storage_connection_string`

A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `storage_sas_token`

The storage account SAS token. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` or `storage_access_key` are set.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

### `filesystem`

The data lake storage filesystem name for uploading the messages to.
This field supports interpolation functions.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

filesystem: messages-${!timestamp("2006")}
```

### `path`

The path of each message to upload within the filesystem.
This field supports interpolation functions.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"${!counter()}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt"`

```yml
# Examples

path: ${!counter()}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.json

path: ${!meta("kafka_key")}.json

path: ${!json("doc.namespace")}/${!json("doc.id")}.json
```

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`
