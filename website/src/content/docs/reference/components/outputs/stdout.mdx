## Fields

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of messages should be written out into the output data stream. It's possible to write lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter.

| Option | Summary |
| ------ | ------- |
| `all-bytes` | Only applicable to file based outputs. Writes each message to a file in full, if the file already exists the old content is deleted. |
| `append` | Append each message to the output stream without any delimiter or special encoding. |
| `lines` | Append each message to the output stream followed by a line break. |
| `delim:x` | Append each message to the output stream followed by a custom delimiter. |
