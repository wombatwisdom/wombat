Reads messages from an AMQP (1.0) server.


== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- amqp_content_type
- amqp_content_encoding
- amqp_creation_time
- All string typed message annotations
```

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].

By setting `read_header` to `true`, additional message header properties will be added to each message:

```text
- amqp_durable
- amqp_priority
- amqp_ttl
- amqp_first_acquirer
- amqp_delivery_count
```

## Performance

This input benefits from receiving multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance.
You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the field `credit`.





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `urls` | `array` | `` | A list of URLs to connect to. The first URL to successfully establish a connection will be used until the connection is closed. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs. |
| `source_address` | `string` | `` | The source address to consume from. |
| `azure_renew_lock` | `bool` | `false` | Experimental: Azure service bus specific option to renew lock if processing takes more then configured lock time |
| `read_header` | `bool` | `false` | Read additional message header fields into `amqp_*` metadata properties. |
| `credit` | `int` | `64` | Specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged messages the sender can transmit. Once this limit is reached, no more messages will arrive until messages are acknowledged and settled. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `sasl` | `object` | `` | Enables SASL authentication. |
| `sasl.mechanism` | `string` | `"none"` | The SASL authentication mechanism to use. |
| `sasl.user` | `string` | `""` | A SASL plain text username. It is recommended that you use environment variables to populate this field. |
| `sasl.password` | `string` | `""` | A SASL plain text password. It is recommended that you use environment variables to populate this field. |
