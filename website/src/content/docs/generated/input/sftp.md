Consumes files from an SFTP server.

Introduced in version 3.39.0.


== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- sftp_path

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `address` | `string` | `` | The address of the server to connect to. |
| `credentials` | `object` | `` | The credentials to use to log into the target server. |
| `credentials.username` | `string` | `""` | The username to connect to the SFTP server. |
| `credentials.password` | `string` | `""` | The password for the username to connect to the SFTP server. |
| `credentials.private_key_file` | `string` | `""` | The private key for the username to connect to the SFTP server. |
| `credentials.private_key_pass` | `string` | `""` | Optional passphrase for private key. |
| `paths` | `array` | `` | A list of paths to consume sequentially. Glob patterns are supported. |
| `auto_replay_nacks` | `bool` | `true` | Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation. |
| `scanner` | `scanner` | `{"to_the_end":{}}` | The xref:components:scanners/about.adoc[scanner] by which the stream of bytes consumed will be broken out into individual messages. Scanners are useful for processing large sources of data without holding the entirety of it within memory. For example, the `csv` scanner allows you to process individual CSV rows without loading the entire CSV file in memory at once. |
| `delete_on_finish` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to delete files from the server once they are processed. |
| `watcher` | `object` | `` | An experimental mode whereby the input will periodically scan the target paths for new files and consume them, when all files are consumed the input will continue polling for new files. |
| `watcher.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether file watching is enabled. |
| `watcher.minimum_age` | `string` | `"1s"` | The minimum period of time since a file was last updated before attempting to consume it. Increasing this period decreases the likelihood that a file will be consumed whilst it is still being written to. |
| `watcher.poll_interval` | `string` | `"1s"` | The interval between each attempt to scan the target paths for new files. |
| `watcher.cache` | `string` | `""` | A xref:components:caches/about.adoc[cache resource] for storing the paths of files already consumed. |
