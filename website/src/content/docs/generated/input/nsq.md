== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- nsq_attempts
- nsq_id
- nsq_nsqd_address
- nsq_timestamp

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `nsqd_tcp_addresses` | `array` | `` | A list of nsqd addresses to connect to. |
| `lookupd_http_addresses` | `array` | `` | A list of nsqlookupd addresses to connect to. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `topic` | `string` | `` | The topic to consume from. |
| `channel` | `string` | `` | The channel to consume from. |
| `user_agent` | `string` | `` | A user agent to assume when connecting. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `100` | The maximum number of pending messages to consume at any given time. |
| `max_attempts` | `int` | `5` | The maximum number of attempts to successfully consume a messages. |
