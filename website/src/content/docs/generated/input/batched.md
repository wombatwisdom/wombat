Consumes data from a child input and applies a batching policy to the stream.

Introduced in version 4.11.0.


Batching at the input level is sometimes useful for processing across micro-batches, and can also sometimes be a useful performance trick. However, most inputs are fine without it so unless you have a specific plan for batching this component is not worth using.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `child` | `input` | `` | The child input. |
| `policy` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `policy.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `policy.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `policy.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `policy.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `policy.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
