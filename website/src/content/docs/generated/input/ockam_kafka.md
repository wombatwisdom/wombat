## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `kafka` | `object` | `` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `kafka.seed_brokers` | `array` | `` | A list of broker addresses to connect to in order to establish connections. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses. |
| `kafka.topics` | `array` | `` | A list of topics to consume from. Multiple comma separated topics can be listed in a single element. When a `consumer_group` is specified partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic, otherwise all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, it's possible to specify explicit partitions to consume from with a colon after the topic name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges, e.g. `foo:0-10` would consume partitions 0 through to 10 inclusive.

Finally, it's also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition, e.g. `foo:0:10` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo starting from the offset 10. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from. |
| `kafka.regexp_topics` | `bool` | `false` | Whether listed topics should be interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions this field must remain set to `false`. |
| `kafka.consumer_group` | `string` | `` | An optional consumer group to consume as. When specified the partitions of specified topics are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group, and partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name. Consumer groups are not supported when specifying explicit partitions to consume from in the `topics` field. |
| `kafka.client_id` | `string` | `"benthos"` | An identifier for the client connection. |
| `kafka.rack_id` | `string` | `""` | A rack identifier for this client. |
| `kafka.checkpoint_limit` | `int` | `1024` | Determines how many messages of the same partition can be processed in parallel before applying back pressure. When a message of a given offset is delivered to the output the offset is only allowed to be committed when all messages of prior offsets have also been delivered, this ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, this mechanism also increases the likelihood of duplicates in the event of crashes or server faults, reducing the checkpoint limit will mitigate this. |
| `kafka.auto_replay_nacks` | `bool` | `true` | Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation. |
| `kafka.commit_period` | `string` | `"5s"` | The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown. |
| `kafka.start_from_oldest` | `bool` | `true` | Determines whether to consume from the oldest available offset, otherwise messages are consumed from the latest offset. The setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists. |
| `kafka.tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `kafka.tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `kafka.tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `kafka.tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `kafka.tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `kafka.tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `kafka.tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `kafka.tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `kafka.tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `kafka.tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `kafka.tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `kafka.tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `kafka.sasl` | `array` | `` | Specify one or more methods of SASL authentication. SASL is tried in order; if the broker supports the first mechanism, all connections will use that mechanism. If the first mechanism fails, the client will pick the first supported mechanism. If the broker does not support any client mechanisms, connections will fail. |
| `kafka.sasl[].mechanism` | `string` | `` | The SASL mechanism to use. |
| `kafka.sasl[].username` | `string` | `""` | A username to provide for PLAIN or SCRAM-* authentication. |
| `kafka.sasl[].password` | `string` | `""` | A password to provide for PLAIN or SCRAM-* authentication. |
| `kafka.sasl[].token` | `string` | `""` | The token to use for a single session's OAUTHBEARER authentication. |
| `kafka.sasl[].extensions` | `object` | `` | Key/value pairs to add to OAUTHBEARER authentication requests. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws` | `object` | `` | Contains AWS specific fields for when the `mechanism` is set to `AWS_MSK_IAM`. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.region` | `string` | `""` | The AWS region to target. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.endpoint` | `string` | `""` | Allows you to specify a custom endpoint for the AWS API. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials` | `object` | `` | Optional manual configuration of AWS credentials to use. More information can be found in xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[]. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.profile` | `string` | `""` | A profile from `~/.aws/credentials` to use. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.id` | `string` | `""` | The ID of credentials to use. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.secret` | `string` | `""` | The secret for the credentials being used. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.token` | `string` | `""` | The token for the credentials being used, required when using short term credentials. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.from_ec2_role` | `bool` | `false` | Use the credentials of a host EC2 machine configured to assume https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html[an IAM role associated with the instance^]. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.role` | `string` | `""` | A role ARN to assume. |
| `kafka.sasl[].aws.credentials.role_external_id` | `string` | `""` | An external ID to provide when assuming a role. |
| `kafka.multi_header` | `bool` | `false` | Decode headers into lists to allow handling of multiple values with the same key |
| `kafka.batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy] that applies to individual topic partitions in order to batch messages together before flushing them for processing. Batching can be beneficial for performance as well as useful for windowed processing, and doing so this way preserves the ordering of topic partitions. |
| `kafka.batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `kafka.batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `kafka.batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `kafka.batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `kafka.batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `kafka.metadata_max_age` | `string` | `"5m"` | The maximum age of metadata before it is refreshed. |
| `kafka.seed_brokers` | `array` | `` | A list of broker addresses to connect to in order to establish connections. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses. |
| `disable_content_encryption` | `bool` | `false` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `enrollment_ticket` | `string` | `` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `identity_name` | `string` | `` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `allow` | `string` | `"self"` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `route_to_kafka_outlet` | `string` | `"self"` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `allow_producer` | `string` | `"self"` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `relay` | `string` | `` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `node_address` | `string` | `"127.0.0.1:6262"` | Sorry! This field is missing documentation. |
| `encrypted_fields` | `array` | `[]` | The fields to encrypt in the kafka messages, assuming the record is a valid JSON map. By default, the whole record is encrypted. |
