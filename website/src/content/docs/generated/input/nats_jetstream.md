Reads messages from NATS JetStream subjects.

Introduced in version 3.46.0.


== Consume mirrored streams

In the case where a stream being consumed is mirrored from a different JetStream domain the stream cannot be resolved from the subject name alone, and so the stream name as well as the subject (if applicable) must both be specified.

## Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- nats_subject
- nats_sequence_stream
- nats_sequence_consumer
- nats_num_delivered
- nats_num_pending
- nats_domain
- nats_timestamp_unix_nano
```

You can access these metadata fields using
xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].

## Connection name

When monitoring and managing a production NATS system, it is often useful to
know which connection a message was send/received from. This can be achieved by
setting the connection name option when creating a NATS connection.

Redpanda Connect will automatically set the connection name based off the label of the given
NATS component, so that monitoring tools between NATS and Redpanda Connect can stay in sync.


## Authentication

There are several components within Redpanda Connect which uses NATS services. You will find that each of these components
support optional advanced authentication parameters for https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKeys^]
and https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[User Credentials^].

See an https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/security/jwt[in-depth tutorial^].

=== NKey file

The NATS server can use these NKeys in several ways for authentication. The simplest is for the server to be configured
with a list of known public keys and for the clients to respond to the challenge by signing it with its private NKey
configured in the `nkey_file` field.

https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[More details^].

=== User credentials

NATS server supports decentralized authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Clients need an https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt#json-web-tokens[user JWT^]
and a corresponding https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKey secret^] when connecting to a server
which is configured to use this authentication scheme.

The `user_credentials_file` field should point to a file containing both the private key and the JWT and can be
generated with the https://docs.nats.io/nats-tools/nsc[nsc tool^].

Alternatively, the `user_jwt` field can contain a plain text JWT and the `user_nkey_seed`can contain
the plain text NKey Seed.

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `urls` | `array` | `` | A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs. |
| `queue` | `string` | `` | An optional queue group to consume as. Used to configure a push consumer. |
| `subject` | `string` | `` | A subject to consume from. Supports wildcards for consuming multiple subjects. Either a subject or stream must be specified. |
| `durable` | `string` | `` | Preserve the state of your consumer under a durable name. Used to configure a pull consumer. |
| `stream` | `string` | `` | A stream to consume from. Either a subject or stream must be specified. |
| `bind` | `bool` | `` | Indicates that the subscription should use an existing consumer. |
| `deliver` | `string` | `"all"` | Determines which messages to deliver when consuming without a durable subscriber. |
| `ack_wait` | `string` | `"30s"` | The maximum amount of time NATS server should wait for an ack from consumer. |
| `max_ack_pending` | `int` | `1024` | The maximum number of outstanding acks to be allowed before consuming is halted. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `auth` | `object` | `` | Optional configuration of NATS authentication parameters. |
| `auth.nkey_file` | `string` | `` | An optional file containing a NKey seed. |
| `auth.user_credentials_file` | `string` | `` | An optional file containing user credentials which consist of an user JWT and corresponding NKey seed. |
| `auth.user_jwt` | `string` | `` | An optional plain text user JWT (given along with the corresponding user NKey Seed). |
| `auth.user_nkey_seed` | `string` | `` | An optional plain text user NKey Seed (given along with the corresponding user JWT). |
| `extract_tracing_map` | `string` | `` | EXPERIMENTAL: A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] that attempts to extract an object containing tracing propagation information, which will then be used as the root tracing span for the message. The specification of the extracted fields must match the format used by the service wide tracer. |
