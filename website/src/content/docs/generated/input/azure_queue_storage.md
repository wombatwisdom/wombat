Dequeue objects from an Azure Storage Queue.

Introduced in version 3.42.0.


This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- queue_storage_insertion_time
- queue_storage_queue_name
- queue_storage_message_lag (if 'track_properties' set to true)
- All user defined queue metadata
```

Only one authentication method is required, `storage_connection_string` or `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`. If both are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `storage_account` | `string` | `""` | The storage account to access. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set. |
| `storage_access_key` | `string` | `""` | The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set. |
| `storage_connection_string` | `string` | `""` | A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set. |
| `queue_name` | `string` | `` | The name of the source storage queue. |
| `dequeue_visibility_timeout` | `string` | `"30s"` | The timeout duration until a dequeued message gets visible again, 30s by default |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `10` | The maximum number of unprocessed messages to fetch at a given time. |
| `track_properties` | `bool` | `false` | If set to `true` the queue is polled on each read request for information such as the queue message lag. These properties are added to consumed messages as metadata, but will also have a negative performance impact. |
