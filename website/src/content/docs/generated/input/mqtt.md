== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- mqtt_duplicate
- mqtt_qos
- mqtt_retained
- mqtt_topic
- mqtt_message_id

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `urls` | `array` | `` | A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs. |
| `client_id` | `string` | `""` | An identifier for the client connection. |
| `dynamic_client_id_suffix` | `string` | `` | Append a dynamically generated suffix to the specified `client_id` on each run of the pipeline. This can be useful when clustering Redpanda Connect producers. |
| `connect_timeout` | `string` | `"30s"` | The maximum amount of time to wait in order to establish a connection before the attempt is abandoned. |
| `will` | `object` | `` | Set last will message in case of Redpanda Connect failure |
| `will.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to enable last will messages. |
| `will.qos` | `int` | `0` | Set QoS for last will message. Valid values are: 0, 1, 2. |
| `will.retained` | `bool` | `false` | Set retained for last will message. |
| `will.topic` | `string` | `""` | Set topic for last will message. |
| `will.payload` | `string` | `""` | Set payload for last will message. |
| `user` | `string` | `""` | A username to connect with. |
| `password` | `string` | `""` | A password to connect with. |
| `keepalive` | `int` | `30` | Max seconds of inactivity before a keepalive message is sent. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `topics` | `array` | `` | A list of topics to consume from. |
| `qos` | `int` | `1` | The level of delivery guarantee to enforce. Has options 0, 1, 2. |
| `clean_session` | `bool` | `true` | Set whether the connection is non-persistent. |
| `auto_replay_nacks` | `bool` | `true` | Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation. |
