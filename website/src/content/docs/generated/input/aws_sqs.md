Consume messages from an AWS SQS URL.


== Credentials

By default Redpanda Connect will use a shared credentials file when connecting to AWS
services. It's also possible to set them explicitly at the component level,
allowing you to transfer data across accounts. You can find out more in
xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[].

## Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- sqs_message_id
- sqs_receipt_handle
- sqs_approximate_receive_count
- All message attributes

You can access these metadata fields using
xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].
