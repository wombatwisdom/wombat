Executes a SQL query against https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction[Azure CosmosDB^] and creates a batch of messages from each page of items.

Introduced in version v4.25.0.


== Cross-partition queries

Cross-partition queries are currently not supported by the underlying driver. For every query, the PartitionKey values must be known in advance and specified in the config. https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/18578#issuecomment-1222510989[See details^].


## Credentials

You can use one of the following authentication mechanisms:

- Set the `endpoint` field and the `account_key` field
- Set only the `endpoint` field to use https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential[DefaultAzureCredential^]
- Set the `connection_string` field


## Metadata

This component adds the following metadata fields to each message:
```
- activity_id
- request_charge
```

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `endpoint` | `string` | `` | CosmosDB endpoint. |
| `account_key` | `string` | `` | Account key. |
| `connection_string` | `string` | `` | Connection string. |
| `database` | `string` | `` | Database. |
| `container` | `string` | `` | Container. |
| `partition_keys_map` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to a single partition key value or an array of partition key values of type string, integer or boolean. Currently, hierarchical partition keys are not supported so only one value may be provided. |
| `query` | `string` | `` | The query to execute |
| `args_mapping` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] that, for each message, creates a list of arguments to use with the query. |
| `batch_count` | `int` | `-1` | The maximum number of messages that should be accumulated into each batch. Use '-1' specify dynamic page size. |
| `auto_replay_nacks` | `bool` | `true` | Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation. |


== CosmosDB emulator

If you wish to run the CosmosDB emulator that is referenced in the documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/linux-emulator[here^], the following Docker command should do the trick:

```bash
> docker run --rm -it -p 8081:8081 --name=cosmosdb -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT=10 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_ENABLE_DATA_PERSISTENCE=false mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator
```

Note: `AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT` controls the number of partitions that will be supported by the emulator. The bigger the value, the longer it takes for the container to start up.

Additionally, instead of installing the container self-signed certificate which is exposed via `https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem`, you can run https://mitmproxy.org/[mitmproxy^] like so:

```bash
> mitmproxy -k --mode "reverse:https://localhost:8081"
```

Then you can access the CosmosDB UI via `http://localhost:8080/_explorer/index.html` and use `http://localhost:8080` as the CosmosDB endpoint.
