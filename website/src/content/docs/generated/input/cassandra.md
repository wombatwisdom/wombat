Executes a find query and creates a message for each row received.



## Examples

Let's presume that we have 3 Cassandra nodes, like in this tutorial by Sebastian Sigl from freeCodeCamp:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-apache-cassandra-beginner-tutorial/

Then if we want to select everything from the table users_by_country, we should use the configuration below.
If we specify the stdin output, the result will look like:

```json
{"age":23,"country":"UK","first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Sandler","user_email":"bob@email.com"}
```

This configuration also works for Scylla.

	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
input:
  cassandra:
    addresses:
      - 172.17.0.2
    query:
      'SELECT * FROM learn_cassandra.users_by_country'

	</code-block>
</tab>

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `addresses` | `array` | `` | A list of Cassandra nodes to connect to. Multiple comma separated addresses can be specified on a single line. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `password_authenticator` | `object` | `` | Optional configuration of Cassandra authentication parameters. |
| `password_authenticator.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use password authentication |
| `password_authenticator.username` | `string` | `""` | The username to authenticate as. |
| `password_authenticator.password` | `string` | `""` | The password to authenticate with. |
| `disable_initial_host_lookup` | `bool` | `false` | If enabled the driver will not attempt to get host info from the system.peers table. This can speed up queries but will mean that data_centre, rack and token information will not be available. |
| `max_retries` | `int` | `3` | The maximum number of retries before giving up on a request. |
| `backoff` | `object` | `` | Control time intervals between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.initial_interval` | `string` | `"1s"` | The initial period to wait between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.max_interval` | `string` | `"5s"` | The maximum period to wait between retry attempts. |
| `timeout` | `string` | `"600ms"` | The client connection timeout. |
| `query` | `string` | `` | A query to execute. |
| `auto_replay_nacks` | `bool` | `true` | Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation. |
