Combines multiple caches as levels, performing read-through and write-through operations across them.



## Examples

<tab title="Example 0">
	The multilevel cache is useful for reducing traffic against a remote cache by routing it through a local cache. In the following example requests will only go through to the memcached server if the local memory cache is missing the key.
	<code-block lang="yaml">

  processors:
    - branch:

              key: ${! json("key") }
