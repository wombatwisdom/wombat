Stores key/value pairs as a single document in a DynamoDB table. The key is stored as a string value and used as the table hash key. The value is stored as
a binary value using the `data_key` field name.

Introduced in version 3.36.0.


A prefix can be specified to allow multiple cache types to share a single DynamoDB table. An optional TTL duration (`ttl`) and field
(`ttl_key`) can be specified if the backing table has TTL enabled.

Strong read consistency can be enabled using the `consistent_read` configuration field.
