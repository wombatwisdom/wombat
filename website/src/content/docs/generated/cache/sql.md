Uses an SQL database table as a destination for storing cache key/value items.

Introduced in version 4.26.0.


Each cache key/value pair will exist as a row within the specified table. Currently only the key and value columns are set, and therefore any other columns present within the target table must allow NULL values if this cache is going to be used for set and add operations.

Cache operations are translated into SQL statements as follows:

## Get

All `get` operations are performed with a traditional `select` statement.

## Delete

All `delete` operations are performed with a traditional `delete` statement.

## Set

The `set` operation is performed with a traditional `insert` statement.

This will behave as an `add` operation by default, and so ideally needs to be adapted in order to provide updates instead of failing on collision	s. Since different SQL engines implement upserts differently it is necessary to specify a `set_suffix` that modifies an `insert` statement in order to perform updates on conflict.

## Add

The `add` operation is performed with a traditional `insert` statement.





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `driver` | `string` | `` | A database <<drivers, driver>> to use. |
| `dsn` | `string` | `` | A Data Source Name to identify the target database.

==== Drivers

:driver-support: mysql=certified, postgres=certified, clickhouse=community, mssql=community, sqlite=certified, oracle=certified, snowflake=community, trino=community, gocosmos=community

The following is a list of supported drivers, their placeholder style, and their respective DSN formats:

|===
| Driver | Data Source Name Format

| `clickhouse` 
| https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn[`clickhouse://[username[:password\]@\][netloc\][:port\]/dbname[?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN\]`^] 

| `mysql` 
| `[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/dbname[?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN]` 

| `postgres` 
| `postgres://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]` 

| `mssql` 
| `sqlserver://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][?database=dbname&param1=value1&...]` 

| `sqlite` 
| `file:/path/to/filename.db[?param&=value1&...]` 

| `oracle` 
| `oracle://[username[:password]@][netloc][:port]/service_name?server=server2&server=server3` 

| `snowflake` 
| `username[:password]@account_identifier/dbname/schemaname[?param1=value&...&paramN=valueN]` 

| `trino` 
| https://github.com/trinodb/trino-go-client#dsn-data-source-name[`http[s\]://user[:pass\]@host[:port\][?parameters\]`^] 

| `gocosmos` 
| https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/microsoft/gocosmos#readme-example-usage[`AccountEndpoint=<cosmosdb-endpoint>;AccountKey=<cosmosdb-account-key>[;TimeoutMs=<timeout-in-ms>\][;Version=<cosmosdb-api-version>\][;DefaultDb/Db=<db-name>\][;AutoId=<true/false>\][;InsecureSkipVerify=<true/false>\]`^] 
|===

Please note that the `postgres` driver enforces SSL by default, you can override this with the parameter `sslmode=disable` if required.

The `snowflake` driver supports multiple DSN formats. Please consult https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Connection_String[the docs^] for more details. For https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#configuring-key-pair-authentication[key pair authentication^], the DSN has the following format: `<snowflake_user>@<snowflake_account>/<db_name>/<schema_name>?warehouse=<warehouse>&role=<role>&authenticator=snowflake_jwt&privateKey=<base64_url_encoded_private_key>`, where the value for the `privateKey` parameter can be constructed from an unencrypted RSA private key file `rsa_key.p8` using `openssl enc -d -base64 -in rsa_key.p8 | basenc --base64url -w0` (you can use `gbasenc` insted of `basenc` on OSX if you install `coreutils` via Homebrew). If you have a password-encrypted private key, you can decrypt it using `openssl pkcs8 -in rsa_key_encrypted.p8 -out rsa_key.p8`. Also, make sure fields such as the username are URL-encoded.

The https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/microsoft/gocosmos[`gocosmos`^] driver is still experimental, but it has support for https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/hierarchical-partition-keys[hierarchical partition keys^] as well as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-query-container#cross-partition-query[cross-partition queries^]. Please refer to the https://github.com/microsoft/gocosmos/blob/main/SQL.md[SQL notes^] for details. |
| `table` | `string` | `` | The table to insert/read/delete cache items. |
| `key_column` | `string` | `` | The name of a column to be used for storing cache item keys. This column should support strings of arbitrary size. |
| `value_column` | `string` | `` | The name of a column to be used for storing cache item values. This column should support strings of arbitrary size. |
| `set_suffix` | `string` | `` | An optional suffix to append to each insert query for a cache `set` operation. This should modify an insert statement into an upsert appropriate for the given SQL engine. |
| `init_files` | `array` | `` | An optional list of file paths containing SQL statements to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).

Care should be taken to ensure that the statements are idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts. If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If a statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped. |

| `conn_max_idle` | `int` | `2` | An optional maximum number of connections in the idle connection pool. If conn_max_open is greater than 0 but less than the new conn_max_idle, then the new conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, no idle connections are retained. The default max idle connections is currently 2. This may change in a future release. |
| `conn_max_open` | `int` | `` | An optional maximum number of open connections to the database. If conn_max_idle is greater than 0 and the new conn_max_open is less than conn_max_idle, then conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the new conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 0 (unlimited). |
