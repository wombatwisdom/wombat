Use a Google Cloud Storage bucket as a cache.


It is not possible to atomically upload cloud storage objects exclusively when the target does not already exist, therefore this cache is not suitable for deduplication.




## Fields

| `content_type` | `string` | `` | Optional field to explicitly set the Content-Type. |
