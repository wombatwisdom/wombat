Returns the value of a metadata key from the input message as a string, or `null` if the key does not exist. Since values are extracted from the read-only input message they do NOT reflect changes made from within the map. In order to query metadata mutations made within a mapping use the <<root_meta, `root_meta` function>>. This function supports extracting metadata from other messages of a batch with the `from` method.


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.topic = meta("kafka_topic")
	</code-block>
</tab>
<tab title="Example 1">
	The key parameter is optional and if omitted the entire metadata contents are returned as an object.
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.all_metadata = meta()
	</code-block>
</tab>

</tabs>
