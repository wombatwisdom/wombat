Returns the value of a metadata key from the new message being created as a string, or `null` if the key does not exist. Changes made to metadata during a mapping will be reflected by this function.


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.topic = root_meta("kafka_topic")
	</code-block>
</tab>
<tab title="Example 1">
	The key parameter is optional and if omitted the entire metadata contents are returned as an object.
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.all_metadata = root_meta()
	</code-block>
</tab>

</tabs>
