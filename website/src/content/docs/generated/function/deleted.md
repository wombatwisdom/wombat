A function that returns a result indicating that the mapping target should be deleted. Deleting, also known as dropping, messages will result in them being acknowledged as successfully processed to inputs in a Redpanda Connect pipeline. For more information about error handling patterns read xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[].


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root = this
root.bar = deleted()
	</code-block>
</tab>
<tab title="Example 1">
	Since the result is a value it can be used to do things like remove elements of an array within `map_each`.
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.new_nums = this.nums.map_each(num -> if num < 10 { deleted() } else { num - 10 })
	</code-block>
</tab>

</tabs>
