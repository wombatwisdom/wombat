The `count` function is a counter starting at 1 which increments after each time it is called. Count takes an argument which is an identifier for the counter, allowing you to specify multiple unique counters in your configuration.


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root = this
root.id = count("bloblang_function_example")
	</code-block>
</tab>

</tabs>
