Reads a file and returns its contents. Relative paths are resolved from the directory of the process executing the mapping. In order to read files relative to the mapping file use the newer <<file_rel, `file_rel` function>>


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.doc = file(env("BENTHOS_TEST_BLOBLANG_FILE")).parse_json()
	</code-block>
</tab>
<tab title="Example 1">
	When the path parameter is static this function will only read the specified file once and yield the same result for each invocation as an optimization, this means that updates to files during runtime will not be reflected. You can disable this cache with the optional parameter `no_cache`, which when set to `true` will cause the file to be read for each execution of the mapping.
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root.doc = file(path: env("BENTHOS_TEST_BLOBLANG_FILE"), no_cache: true).parse_json()
	</code-block>
