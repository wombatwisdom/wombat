Select a child scanner dynamically for source data based on factors such as the filename.


This scanner outlines a list of potential child scanner candidates to be chosen, and for each source of data the first candidate to pass will be selected. A candidate without any conditions acts as a catch-all and will pass for every source, it is recommended to always have a catch-all scanner at the end of your list. If a given source of data does not pass a candidate an error is returned and the data is rejected.
