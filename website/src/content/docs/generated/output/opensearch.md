Publishes messages into an Elasticsearch index. If the index does not exist then it is created with a dynamic mapping.


Both the `id` and `index` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here]. When sending batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	When https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/document-apis/update-document/[updating documents^] the request body should contain a combination of a `doc`, `upsert`, and/or `script` fields at the top level, this should be done via mapping processors.
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        root.doc = this
  opensearch:
    urls: [ TODO ]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `urls` | `array` | `` | A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs. |
| `index` | `string` | `` | The index to place messages. |
| `action` | `string` | `` | The action to take on the document. This field must resolve to one of the following action types: `index`, `update` or `delete`. |
| `id` | `string` | `` | The ID for indexed messages. Interpolation should be used in order to create a unique ID for each message. |
| `pipeline` | `string` | `""` | An optional pipeline id to preprocess incoming documents. |
| `routing` | `string` | `""` | The routing key to use for the document. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `basic_auth` | `object` | `` | Allows you to specify basic authentication. |
| `basic_auth.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use basic authentication in requests. |
| `basic_auth.username` | `string` | `""` | A username to authenticate as. |
| `basic_auth.password` | `string` | `""` | A password to authenticate with. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `aws` | `object` | `` | Enables and customises connectivity to Amazon Elastic Service. |
| `aws.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to connect to Amazon Elastic Service. |
| `aws.region` | `string` | `""` | The AWS region to target. |
| `aws.endpoint` | `string` | `""` | Allows you to specify a custom endpoint for the AWS API. |
| `aws.credentials` | `object` | `` | Optional manual configuration of AWS credentials to use. More information can be found in xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[]. |
| `aws.credentials.profile` | `string` | `""` | A profile from `~/.aws/credentials` to use. |
| `aws.credentials.id` | `string` | `""` | The ID of credentials to use. |
| `aws.credentials.secret` | `string` | `""` | The secret for the credentials being used. |
| `aws.credentials.token` | `string` | `""` | The token for the credentials being used, required when using short term credentials. |
| `aws.credentials.from_ec2_role` | `bool` | `false` | Use the credentials of a host EC2 machine configured to assume https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html[an IAM role associated with the instance^]. |
| `aws.credentials.role` | `string` | `""` | A role ARN to assume. |
| `aws.credentials.role_external_id` | `string` | `""` | An external ID to provide when assuming a role. |
