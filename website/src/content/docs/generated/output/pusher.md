## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `batching` | `object` | `` | maximum batch size is 10 (limit of the pusher library) |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit.

| `appId` | `string` | `` | Pusher app id |
