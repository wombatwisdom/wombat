A special broker type where the outputs are identified by unique labels and can be created, changed and removed during runtime via a REST API.


The broker pattern used is always `fan_out`, meaning each message will be delivered to each dynamic output.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `outputs` | `object` | `{}` | A map of outputs to statically create. |
| `prefix` | `string` | `""` | A path prefix for HTTP endpoints that are registered. |

== Endpoints

=== GET `/outputs`

Returns a JSON object detailing all dynamic outputs, providing information such as their current uptime and configuration.

=== GET `/outputs/\{id}`

=== POST `/outputs/\{id}`

Creates or updates an output with a configuration provided in the request body (in YAML or JSON format).

=== DELETE `/outputs/\{id}`

=== GET `/outputs/\{id}/uptime`
