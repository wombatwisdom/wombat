Writes messages to files on disk based on a chosen codec.


Messages can be written to different files by using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions] in the path field. However, only one file is ever open at a given time, and therefore when the path changes the previously open file is closed.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `path` | `string` | `` | The file to write to, if the file does not yet exist it will be created. |
| `codec` | `string` | `"lines"` | The way in which the bytes of messages should be written out into the output data stream. It's possible to write lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter. |
