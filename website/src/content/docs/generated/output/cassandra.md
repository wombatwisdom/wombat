Runs a query against a Cassandra database for each message in order to insert data.


Query arguments can be set using a bloblang array for the fields using the `args_mapping` field.

When populating timestamp columns the value must either be a string in ISO 8601 format (2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00), or an integer representing unix time in seconds.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	If we were to create a table with some basic columns with `CREATE TABLE foo.bar (id int primary key, content text, created_at timestamp);`, and were processing JSON documents of the form `{"id":"342354354","content":"hello world","timestamp":1605219406}` using logged batches, we could populate our table with the following config:
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
output:
  cassandra:
    addresses:
      - localhost:9042
    query: 'INSERT INTO foo.bar (id, content, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)'
    args_mapping: |
      root = [
        this.id,
        this.content,
        this.timestamp
      ]
    batching:
      count: 500
      period: 1s

	</code-block>
</tab>
<tab title="Example 1">
	The following example inserts JSON documents into the table `footable` of the keyspace `foospace` using INSERT JSON (https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/json.html#insert-json).
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
output:
  cassandra:
    addresses:
      - localhost:9042
    query: 'INSERT INTO foospace.footable JSON ?'
    args_mapping: 'root = [ this ]'
    batching:
      count: 500
      period: 1s

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `addresses` | `array` | `` | A list of Cassandra nodes to connect to. Multiple comma separated addresses can be specified on a single line. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `password_authenticator` | `object` | `` | Optional configuration of Cassandra authentication parameters. |
| `password_authenticator.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use password authentication |
| `password_authenticator.username` | `string` | `""` | The username to authenticate as. |
| `password_authenticator.password` | `string` | `""` | The password to authenticate with. |
| `disable_initial_host_lookup` | `bool` | `false` | If enabled the driver will not attempt to get host info from the system.peers table. This can speed up queries but will mean that data_centre, rack and token information will not be available. |
| `max_retries` | `int` | `3` | The maximum number of retries before giving up on a request. |
| `backoff` | `object` | `` | Control time intervals between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.initial_interval` | `string` | `"1s"` | The initial period to wait between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.max_interval` | `string` | `"5s"` | The maximum period to wait between retry attempts. |
| `timeout` | `string` | `"600ms"` | The client connection timeout. |
| `query` | `string` | `` | A query to execute for each message. |
| `args_mapping` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] that can be used to provide arguments to Cassandra queries. The result of the query must be an array containing a matching number of elements to the query arguments. |
| `consistency` | `string` | `"QUORUM"` | The consistency level to use. |
| `logged_batch` | `bool` | `true` | If enabled the driver will perform a logged batch. Disabling this prompts unlogged batches to be used instead, which are less efficient but necessary for alternative storages that do not support logged batches. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
