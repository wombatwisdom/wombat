Sends message parts as objects to an Azure Blob Storage Account container. Each object is uploaded with the filename specified with the `container` field.

Introduced in version 3.36.0.


In order to have a different path for each object you should use function
interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here], which are
calculated per message of a batch.

Supports multiple authentication methods but only one of the following is required:

- `storage_connection_string`
- `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`
- `storage_account` and `storage_sas_token`
- `storage_account` to access via https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential[DefaultAzureCredential^]

If multiple are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

If the `storage_connection_string` does not contain the `AccountName` parameter, please specify it in the
`storage_account` field.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `storage_account` | `string` | `""` | The storage account to access. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set. |
| `storage_access_key` | `string` | `""` | The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set. |
| `storage_connection_string` | `string` | `""` | A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set. |
| `storage_sas_token` | `string` | `""` | The storage account SAS token. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` or `storage_access_key` are set. |
| `container` | `string` | `` | The container for uploading the messages to. |
| `path` | `string` | `"${!count(\"files\")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt"` | The path of each message to upload. |
| `blob_type` | `string` | `"BLOCK"` | Block and Append blobs are comprized of blocks, and each blob can support up to 50,000 blocks. The default value is `+"`BLOCK`"+`.` |
| `public_access_level` | `string` | `"PRIVATE"` | The container's public access level. The default value is `PRIVATE`. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
