Sends messages to an HTTP server.


When the number of retries expires the output will reject the message, the behavior after this will depend on the pipeline but usually this simply means the send is attempted again until successful whilst applying back pressure.

The URL and header values of this type can be dynamically set using function interpolations described in xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[Bloblang queries].

The body of the HTTP request is the raw contents of the message payload. If the message has multiple parts (is a batch) the request will be sent according to https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html[RFC1341^]. This behavior can be disabled by setting the field <<batch_as_multipart, `batch_as_multipart`>> to `false`.

## Propagate responses

It's possible to propagate the response from each HTTP request back to the input source by setting `propagate_response` to `true`. Only inputs that support xref:guides:sync_responses.adoc[synchronous responses] are able to make use of these propagated responses.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

Header keys are lowercased before matching, so ensure that your patterns target lowercased versions of the header keys that you expect.

Note that with these status codes the _request_ is dropped, but _message_ that caused the request will not be dropped. |
| `successful_on` | `array` | `[]` | A list of status codes whereby the attempt should be considered successful, this is useful for dropping requests that return non-2XX codes indicating that the message has been dealt with, such as a 303 See Other or a 409 Conflict. All 2XX codes are considered successful unless they are present within `backoff_on` or `drop_on`, regardless of this field. |

| `batch_as_multipart` | `bool` | `false` | Send message batches as a single request using https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html[RFC1341^]. If disabled messages in batches will be sent as individual requests. |

| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `multipart` | `array` | `[]` | EXPERIMENTAL: Create explicit multipart HTTP requests by specifying an array of parts to add to the request, each part specified consists of content headers and a data field that can be populated dynamically.
