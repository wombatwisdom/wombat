Inserts items into a Pinecone index.

Introduced in version 4.31.0.



## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `host` | `string` | `` | The host for the Pinecone index. |
| `api_key` | `string` | `` | The Pinecone api key. |
| `operation` | `string` | `"upsert-vectors"` | The operation to perform against the Pinecone index. |
| `namespace` | `string` | `""` | The namespace to write to - writes to the default namespace by default. |
| `id` | `string` | `` | The ID for the index entry in Pinecone. |
| `vector_mapping` | `string` | `` | The mapping to extract out the vector from the document. The result must be a floating point array. Required if not a delete operation. |
| `metadata_mapping` | `string` | `` | An optional mapping of message to metadata in the Pinecone index entry. |
