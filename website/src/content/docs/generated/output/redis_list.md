Pushes messages onto the end of a Redis list (which is created if it doesn't already exist) using the RPUSH command.


The field `key` supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions], allowing you to create a unique key for each message.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `url` | `string` | `` | The URL of the target Redis server. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path. |
| `kind` | `string` | `"simple"` | Specifies a simple, cluster-aware, or failover-aware redis client. |
| `master` | `string` | `""` | Name of the redis master when `kind` is `failover` |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

**Troubleshooting**

Some cloud hosted instances of Redis (such as Azure Cache) might need some hand holding in order to establish stable connections. Unfortunately, it is often the case that TLS issues will manifest as generic error messages such as "i/o timeout". If you're using TLS and are seeing connectivity problems consider setting `enable_renegotiation` to `true`, and ensuring that the server supports at least TLS version 1.2. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `key` | `string` | `` | The key for each message, function interpolations can be optionally used to create a unique key per message. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `command` | `string` | `"rpush"` | The command used to push elements to the Redis list |
