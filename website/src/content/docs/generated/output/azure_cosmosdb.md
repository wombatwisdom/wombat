Creates or updates messages as JSON documents in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction[Azure CosmosDB^].

Introduced in version v4.25.0.


When creating documents, each message must have the `id` property (case-sensitive) set (or use `auto_id: true`). It is the unique name that identifies the document, that is, no two documents share the same `id` within a logical partition. The `id` field must not exceed 255 characters. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/documents[See details^].

The `partition_keys` field must resolve to the same value(s) across the entire message batch.


## Credentials

You can use one of the following authentication mechanisms:

- Set the `endpoint` field and the `account_key` field
- Set only the `endpoint` field to use https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential[DefaultAzureCredential^]
- Set the `connection_string` field


## Batching

CosmosDB limits the maximum batch size to 100 messages and the payload must not exceed 2MB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits#per-request-limits[details here^]).


## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `endpoint` | `string` | `` | CosmosDB endpoint. |
| `account_key` | `string` | `` | Account key. |
| `connection_string` | `string` | `` | Connection string. |
| `database` | `string` | `` | Database. |
| `container` | `string` | `` | Container. |
| `partition_keys_map` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to a single partition key value or an array of partition key values of type string, integer or boolean. Currently, hierarchical partition keys are not supported so only one value may be provided. |
| `operation` | `string` | `"Create"` | Operation. |
| `patch_operations` | `array` | `` | Patch operations to be performed when `operation: Patch` . |
| `patch_operations[].operation` | `string` | `"Add"` | Operation. |
| `patch_operations[].path` | `string` | `` | Path. |
| `patch_operations[].value_map` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to a value of any type that is supported by CosmosDB. |
| `patch_condition` | `string` | `` | Patch operation condition. |
| `auto_id` | `bool` | `true` | Automatically set the item `id` field to a random UUID v4. If the `id` field is already set, then it will not be overwritten. Setting this to `false` can improve performance, since the messages will not have to be parsed. |
| `item_id` | `string` | `` | ID of item to replace or delete. Only used by the Replace and Delete operations |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |


== CosmosDB emulator

If you wish to run the CosmosDB emulator that is referenced in the documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/linux-emulator[here^], the following Docker command should do the trick:

```bash
> docker run --rm -it -p 8081:8081 --name=cosmosdb -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT=10 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_ENABLE_DATA_PERSISTENCE=false mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator
```

Note: `AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT` controls the number of partitions that will be supported by the emulator. The bigger the value, the longer it takes for the container to start up.

Additionally, instead of installing the container self-signed certificate which is exposed via `https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem`, you can run https://mitmproxy.org/[mitmproxy^] like so:

```bash
> mitmproxy -k --mode "reverse:https://localhost:8081"
```

Then you can access the CosmosDB UI via `http://localhost:8080/_explorer/index.html` and use `http://localhost:8080` as the CosmosDB endpoint.
