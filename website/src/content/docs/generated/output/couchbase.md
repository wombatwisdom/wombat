Performs operations against Couchbase for each message, allowing you to store or delete data.

Introduced in version 4.37.0.


When inserting, replacing or upserting documents, each must have the `content` property set.


## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `url` | `string` | `` | Couchbase connection string. |
| `username` | `string` | `` | Username to connect to the cluster. |
| `password` | `string` | `` | Password to connect to the cluster. |
| `bucket` | `string` | `` | Couchbase bucket. |
| `collection` | `string` | `"_default"` | Bucket collection. |
| `transcoder` | `string` | `"legacy"` | Couchbase transcoder to use. |
| `timeout` | `string` | `"15s"` | Operation timeout. |
| `id` | `string` | `` | Document id. |
| `content` | `string` | `` | Document content. |
| `operation` | `string` | `"upsert"` | Couchbase operation to perform. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
