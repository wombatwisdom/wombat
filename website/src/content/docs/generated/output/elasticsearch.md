Publishes messages into an Elasticsearch index. If the index does not exist then it is created with a dynamic mapping.


Both the `id` and `index` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described in xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[Bloblang queries]. When sending batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

## AWS

It's possible to enable AWS connectivity with this output using the `aws` fields. However, you may need to set `sniff` and `healthcheck` to false for connections to succeed.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `urls` | `array` | `` | A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs. |
| `index` | `string` | `` | The index to place messages. |
| `action` | `string` | `"index"` | The action to take on the document. This field must resolve to one of the following action types: `create`, `index`, `update`, `upsert` or `delete`. |
| `pipeline` | `string` | `""` | An optional pipeline id to preprocess incoming documents. |
| `id` | `string` | `"${!count(\"elastic_ids\")}-${!timestamp_unix()}"` | The ID for indexed messages. Interpolation should be used in order to create a unique ID for each message. |
| `type` | `string` | `""` | The document mapping type. This field is required for versions of elasticsearch earlier than 6.0.0, but are invalid for versions 7.0.0 or later. |
| `routing` | `string` | `""` | The routing key to use for the document. |
| `sniff` | `bool` | `true` | Prompts Redpanda Connect to sniff for brokers to connect to when establishing a connection. |
| `healthcheck` | `bool` | `true` | Whether to enable healthchecks. |
| `timeout` | `string` | `"5s"` | The maximum time to wait before abandoning a request (and trying again). |
| `api_key` | `string` | `` | The key to set in the Authorization header if using API keys for authentication. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `max_retries` | `int` | `0` | The maximum number of retries before giving up on the request. If set to zero there is no discrete limit. |
| `backoff` | `object` | `` | Control time intervals between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.initial_interval` | `string` | `"1s"` | The initial period to wait between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.max_interval` | `string` | `"5s"` | The maximum period to wait between retry attempts. |
| `backoff.max_elapsed_time` | `string` | `"30s"` | The maximum period to wait before retry attempts are abandoned. If zero then no limit is used. |
| `basic_auth` | `object` | `` | Allows you to specify basic authentication. |
| `basic_auth.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use basic authentication in requests. |
| `basic_auth.username` | `string` | `""` | A username to authenticate as. |
| `basic_auth.password` | `string` | `""` | A password to authenticate with. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `aws` | `object` | `` | Enables and customises connectivity to Amazon Elastic Service. |
| `aws.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to connect to Amazon Elastic Service. |
| `aws.region` | `string` | `""` | The AWS region to target. |
