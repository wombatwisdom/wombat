Sets up an HTTP server that will send messages over HTTP(S) GET requests. HTTP 2.0 is supported when using TLS, which is enabled when key and cert files are specified.


Sets up an HTTP server that will send messages over HTTP(S) GET requests. If the `address` config field is left blank the xref:components:http/about.adoc[service-wide HTTP server] will be used.

Three endpoints will be registered at the paths specified by the fields `path`, `stream_path` and `ws_path`. Which allow you to consume a single message batch, a continuous stream of line delimited messages, or a websocket of messages for each request respectively.

When messages are batched the `path` endpoint encodes the batch according to https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html[RFC1341^]. This behavior can be overridden by xref:configuration:batching.adoc#post-batch-processing[archiving your batches].

Please note, messages are considered delivered as soon as the data is written to the client. There is no concept of at least once delivery on this output.


[CAUTION]
.Endpoint caveats
====
Components within a Redpanda Connect config will register their respective endpoints in a non-deterministic order. This means that establishing precedence of endpoints that are registered via multiple `http_server` inputs or outputs (either within brokers or from cohabiting streams) is not possible in a predictable way.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to ensure that paths which are both a subset of a path registered by a separate component, and end in a slash (`/`) and will therefore match against all extensions of that path, do not prevent the more specific path from matching against requests.

It is therefore recommended that you ensure paths of separate components do not collide unless they are explicitly non-competing.

For example, if you were to deploy two separate `http_server` inputs, one with a path `/foo/` and the other with a path `/foo/bar`, it would not be possible to ensure that the path `/foo/` does not swallow requests made to `/foo/bar`.

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `address` | `string` | `""` | An alternative address to host from. If left empty the service wide address is used. |
| `path` | `string` | `"/get"` | The path from which discrete messages can be consumed. |
| `stream_path` | `string` | `"/get/stream"` | The path from which a continuous stream of messages can be consumed. |
| `ws_path` | `string` | `"/get/ws"` | The path from which websocket connections can be established. |
| `allowed_verbs` | `array` | `["GET"]` | An array of verbs that are allowed for the `path` and `stream_path` HTTP endpoint. |
| `timeout` | `string` | `"5s"` | The maximum time to wait before a blocking, inactive connection is dropped (only applies to the `path` endpoint). |
| `cert_file` | `string` | `""` | Enable TLS by specifying a certificate and key file. Only valid with a custom `address`. |
| `key_file` | `string` | `""` | Enable TLS by specifying a certificate and key file. Only valid with a custom `address`. |
| `cors` | `object` | `` | Adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers. Only valid with a custom `address`. |
| `cors.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow CORS requests. |
| `cors.allowed_origins` | `array` | `[]` | An explicit list of origins that are allowed for CORS requests. |
