Sends messages to Snowflake stages and, optionally, calls Snowpipe to load this data into one or more tables.

Introduced in version 1.0.0.


In order to use a different stage and / or Snowpipe for each message, you can use function interpolations as described
[here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries). When using batching, messages are grouped by the calculated
stage and Snowpipe and are streamed to individual files in their corresponding stage and, optionally, a Snowpipe
`insertFiles` REST API call will be made for each individual file.

### Credentials

Two authentication mechanisms are supported:
- User/password
- Key Pair Authentication

#### User/password

This is a basic authentication mechanism which allows you to PUT data into a stage. However, it is not compatible with
Snowpipe.

#### Key Pair Authentication

This authentication mechanism allows Snowpipe functionality, but it does require configuring an SSH Private Key
beforehand. Please consult the [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#configuring-key-pair-authentication)
for details on how to set it up and assign the Public Key to your user.

Note that the Snowflake documentation [used to suggest](https://twitter.com/felipehoffa/status/1560811785606684672)
using this command:

```shell
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
```

to generate an encrypted SSH private key. However, in this case, it uses an encryption algorithm called
`pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC`, which is part of the PKCS#5 v1.5 and is considered insecure. Due to this, Bento does not
support it and, if you wish to use password-protected keys directly, you must use PKCS#5 v2.0 to encrypt them by using
the following command (as the current Snowflake docs suggest):

```shell
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
```

If you have an existing key encrypted with PKCS#5 v1.5, you can re-encrypt it with PKCS#5 v2.0 using this command:

```shell
openssl pkcs8 -in rsa_key_original.p8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -out rsa_key.p8
```

Please consult [this](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkcs8) pkcs8 command documentation for details on PKCS#5 algorithms.

### Batching

It's common to want to upload messages to Snowflake as batched archives. The easiest way to do this is to batch your
messages at the output level and join the batch of messages with an
[`archive`](/docs/components/processors/archive) and/or [`compress`](/docs/components/processors/compress)
processor.

For the optimal batch size, please consult the Snowflake [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-prepare.html).

### Snowpipe

Given a table called `BENTO_TBL` with one column of type `variant`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BENTO_DB.PUBLIC.BENTO_TBL(RECORD variant)
```

and the following `BENTO_PIPE` Snowpipe:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PIPE BENTO_DB.PUBLIC.BENTO_PIPE AUTO_INGEST = FALSE AS COPY INTO BENTO_DB.PUBLIC.BENTO_TBL FROM (SELECT * FROM @%BENTO_TBL) FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = JSON COMPRESSION = AUTO)
```

you can configure Bento to use the implicit table stage `@%BENTO_TBL` as the `stage` and
`BENTO_PIPE` as the `snowpipe`. In this case, you must set `compression` to `AUTO` and, if
using message batching, you'll need to configure an [`archive`](/docs/components/processors/archive) processor
with the `concatenate` format. Since the `compression` is set to `AUTO`, the
[gosnowflake](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) client library will compress the messages automatically so you
don't need to add a [`compress`](/docs/components/processors/compress) processor for message batches.

If you add `STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY = TRUE` in your Snowpipe `FILE_FORMAT`
definition, then you must use `json_array` instead of `concatenate` as the archive processor format.

Note: Only Snowpipes with `FILE_FORMAT` `TYPE` `JSON` are currently supported.

### Snowpipe Troubleshooting

Snowpipe [provides](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-apis.html) the `insertReport`
and `loadHistoryScan` REST API endpoints which can be used to get information about recent Snowpipe calls. In
order to query them, you'll first need to generate a valid JWT token for your Snowflake account. There are two methods
for doing so:
- Using the `snowsql` [utility](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html):

```shell
snowsql --private-key-path rsa_key.p8 --generate-jwt -a <account> -u <user>
```

- Using the Python `sql-api-generate-jwt` [utility](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating.html#generating-a-jwt-in-python):

```shell
python3 sql-api-generate-jwt.py --private_key_file_path=rsa_key.p8 --account=<account> --user=<user>
```

Once you successfully generate a JWT token and store it into the `JWT_TOKEN` environment variable, then you can,
for example, query the `insertReport` endpoint using `curl`:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" "https://<account>.snowflakecomputing.com/v1/data/pipes/<database>.<schema>.<snowpipe>/insertReport"
```

If you need to pass in a valid `requestId` to any of these Snowpipe REST API endpoints, you can set a
[uuid_v4()](https://www.bento.dev/docs/guides/bloblang/functions#uuid_v4) string in a metadata field called
`request_id`, log it via the [`log`](https://www.bento.dev/docs/components/processors/log) processor and
then configure `request_id: ${ @request_id }` ). Alternatively, you can enable debug logging as described
[here](/docs/components/logger/about) and Bento will print the Request IDs that it sends to Snowpipe.

### General Troubleshooting

The underlying [`gosnowflake` driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) requires write access to
the default directory to use for temporary files. Please consult the [`os.TempDir`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#TempDir)
docs for details on how to change this directory via environment variables.

A silent failure can occur due to [this issue](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/issues/701), where the
underlying [`gosnowflake` driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) doesn't return an error and doesn't
log a failure if it can't figure out the current username. One way to trigger this behaviour is by running Bento in a
Docker container with a non-existent user ID (such as `--user 1000:1000`).


## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

an [Account Locator](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#using-an-account-locator-as-an-identifier)

This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `1` | The maximum number of parallel message batches to have in flight at any given time. |
