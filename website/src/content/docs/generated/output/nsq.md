Publish to an NSQ topic.


The `topic` field can be dynamically set using function interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here]. When sending batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `nsqd_tcp_address` | `string` | `` | The address of the target NSQD server. |
| `topic` | `string` | `` | The topic to publish to. |
| `user_agent` | `string` | `` | A user agent to assume when connecting. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
