Pushes messages to a QuestDB table


Important: We recommend that the dedupe feature is enabled on the QuestDB server. Please visit https://questdb.io/docs/ for more information about deploying, configuring, and using QuestDB.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `max_in_flight` | `int` | `64` | The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput. |
| `batching` | `object` | `` | Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy]. |
| `batching.count` | `int` | `0` | A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching. |
| `batching.byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching. |
| `batching.period` | `string` | `""` | A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size. |
| `batching.check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch. |
| `batching.processors` | `array` | `` | A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `address` | `string` | `` | Address of the QuestDB server's HTTP port (excluding protocol) |
| `username` | `string` | `` | Username for HTTP basic auth |
| `password` | `string` | `` | Password for HTTP basic auth |
| `token` | `string` | `` | Bearer token for HTTP auth (takes precedence over basic auth username & password) |
| `retry_timeout` | `string` | `` | The time to continue retrying after a failed HTTP request. The interval between retries is an exponential backoff starting at 10ms and doubling after each failed attempt up to a maximum of 1 second. |
| `request_timeout` | `string` | `` | The time to wait for a response from the server. This is in addition to the calculation derived from the request_min_throughput parameter. |
| `request_min_throughput` | `int` | `` | Minimum expected throughput in bytes per second for HTTP requests. If the throughput is lower than this value, the connection will time out. This is used to calculate an additional timeout on top of request_timeout. This is useful for large requests. You can set this value to 0 to disable this logic. |
| `table` | `string` | `` | Destination table |
| `designated_timestamp_field` | `string` | `` | Name of the designated timestamp field |
| `designated_timestamp_unit` | `string` | `"auto"` | Designated timestamp field units |
| `timestamp_string_fields` | `array` | `` | String fields with textual timestamps |
| `timestamp_string_format` | `string` | `"Jan _2 15:04:05.000000Z0700"` | Timestamp format, used when parsing timestamp string fields. Specified in golang's time.Parse layout |
| `symbols` | `array` | `` | Columns that should be the SYMBOL type (string values default to STRING) |
| `doubles` | `array` | `` | Columns that should be double type, (int is default) |
| `error_on_empty_messages` | `bool` | `false` | Mark a message as errored if it is empty after field validation |
