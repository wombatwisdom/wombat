Automatically encodes and validates messages with schemas from a Confluent Schema Registry service.

Introduced in version 3.58.0.


Encodes messages automatically from schemas obtains from a https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html[Confluent Schema Registry service^] by polling the service for the latest schema version for target subjects.

If a message fails to encode under the schema then it will remain unchanged and the error can be caught using xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[error handling methods].

Avro, Protobuf and Json schemas are supported, all are capable of expanding from schema references as of v4.22.0.

## Avro JSON format

By default this processor expects documents formatted as https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding[Avro JSON^] when encoding with Avro schemas. In this format the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- if its type is `null`, then it is encoded as a JSON `null`;
- otherwise it is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair whose name is the type's name and whose value is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum) the user-specified name is used, for other types the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Foo"]`, where `Foo` is a record name, would encode:

- `null` as `null`;
- the string `"a"` as `\{"string": "a"}`; and
- a `Foo` instance as `\{"Foo": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Foo` instance.

However, it is possible to instead consume documents in https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard/raw JSON format^] by setting the field <<avro_raw_json, `avro_raw_json`>> to `true`.

=== Known issues

Important! There is an outstanding issue in the https://github.com/linkedin/goavro[avro serializing library^] that Redpanda Connect uses which means it https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/252[doesn't encode logical types correctly^]. It's still possible to encode logical types that are in-line with the spec if `avro_raw_json` is set to true, though now of course non-logical types will not be in-line with the spec.

## Protobuf format

This processor encodes protobuf messages either from any format parsed within Redpanda Connect (encoded as JSON by default), or from raw JSON documents, you can read more about JSON mapping of protobuf messages here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json

=== Multiple message support

When a target subject presents a protobuf schema that contains multiple messages it becomes ambiguous which message definition a given input data should be encoded against. In such scenarios Redpanda Connect will attempt to encode the data against each of them and select the first to successfully match against the data, this process currently *ignores all nested message definitions*. In order to speed up this exhaustive search the last known successful message will be attempted first for each subsequent input.

We will be considering alternative approaches in future so please https://redpanda.com/slack[get in touch^] with thoughts and feedback.





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `url` | `string` | `` | The base URL of the schema registry service. |
| `subject` | `string` | `` | The schema subject to derive schemas from. |
| `refresh_period` | `string` | `"10m"` | The period after which a schema is refreshed for each subject, this is done by polling the schema registry service. |
| `avro_raw_json` | `bool` | `false` | Whether messages encoded in Avro format should be parsed as normal JSON ("json that meets the expectations of regular internet json") rather than https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding[Avro JSON^]. If `true` the schema returned from the subject should be parsed as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard json^] instead of as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodec[avro json^]. There is a https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/blob/5ec5a5ee7ec82e16e6e2b438d610e1cab2588393/union.go#L224-L249[comment in goavro^], the https://github.com/linkedin/goavro[underlining library used for avro serialization^], that explains in more detail the difference between standard json and avro json. |
| `oauth` | `object` | `` | Allows you to specify open authentication via OAuth version 1. |
| `oauth.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use OAuth version 1 in requests. |
| `oauth.consumer_key` | `string` | `""` | A value used to identify the client to the service provider. |
| `oauth.consumer_secret` | `string` | `""` | A secret used to establish ownership of the consumer key. |
| `oauth.access_token` | `string` | `""` | A value used to gain access to the protected resources on behalf of the user. |
| `oauth.access_token_secret` | `string` | `""` | A secret provided in order to establish ownership of a given access token. |
| `basic_auth` | `object` | `` | Allows you to specify basic authentication. |
| `basic_auth.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use basic authentication in requests. |
| `basic_auth.username` | `string` | `""` | A username to authenticate as. |
| `basic_auth.password` | `string` | `""` | A password to authenticate with. |
| `jwt` | `object` | `` | BETA: Allows you to specify JWT authentication. |
| `jwt.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use JWT authentication in requests. |
| `jwt.private_key_file` | `string` | `""` | A file with the PEM encoded via PKCS1 or PKCS8 as private key. |
| `jwt.signing_method` | `string` | `""` | A method used to sign the token such as RS256, RS384, RS512 or EdDSA. |
| `jwt.claims` | `object` | `{}` | A value used to identify the claims that issued the JWT. |
| `jwt.headers` | `object` | `{}` | Add optional key/value headers to the JWT. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
