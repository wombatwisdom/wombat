Checks messages against a provided JSONSchema definition but does not change the payload under any circumstances. If a message does not match the schema it can be caught using xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[error handling methods].


Please refer to the https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema website^] for information and tutorials regarding the syntax of the schema.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `schema` | `string` | `` | A schema to apply. Use either this or the `schema_path` field. |
| `schema_path` | `string` | `` | The path of a schema document to apply. Use either this or the `schema` field. |

== Examples

With the following JSONSchema document:

```json
{
	"$id": "https://example.com/person.schema.json",
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
	"title": "Person",
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
	  "firstName": {
		"type": "string",
		"description": "The person's first name."
	  },
	  "lastName": {
		"type": "string",
		"description": "The person's last name."
	  },
	  "age": {
		"description": "Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.",
		"type": "integer",
		"minimum": 0
	  }
	}
}
```

And the following Redpanda Connect configuration:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
  - json_schema:
      schema_path: "file://path_to_schema.json"
  - catch:
    - log:
        level: ERROR
        message: "Schema validation failed due to: ${!error()}"
    - mapping: 'root = deleted()' # Drop messages that fail
```

If a payload being processed looked like:

```json
{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","age":-21}
```

Then a log message would appear explaining the fault and the payload would be
dropped.
