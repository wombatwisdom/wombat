Performs actions against Redis using https://redis.io/docs/manual/programmability/eval-intro/[LUA scripts^].

Introduced in version 4.11.0.


Actions are performed for each message and the message contents are replaced with the result.

In order to merge the result into the original message compose this processor within a xref:components:processors/branch.adoc[`branch` processor].


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	The following example will use a script execution to get next element from a sorted set and set its score with timestamp unix nano value.
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
pipeline:
  processors:
    - redis_script:
        url: TODO
        script: |
          local value = redis.call("ZRANGE", KEYS[1], '0', '0')

          if next(elements) == nil then
            return ''
          end

          redis.call("ZADD", "XX", KEYS[1], ARGV[1], value)

          return value
        keys_mapping: 'root = [ meta("key") ]'
        args_mapping: 'root = [ timestamp_unix_nano() ]'

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `url` | `string` | `` | The URL of the target Redis server. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path. |
| `kind` | `string` | `"simple"` | Specifies a simple, cluster-aware, or failover-aware redis client. |
| `master` | `string` | `""` | Name of the redis master when `kind` is `failover` |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

**Troubleshooting**

Some cloud hosted instances of Redis (such as Azure Cache) might need some hand holding in order to establish stable connections. Unfortunately, it is often the case that TLS issues will manifest as generic error messages such as "i/o timeout". If you're using TLS and are seeing connectivity problems consider setting `enable_renegotiation` to `true`, and ensuring that the server supports at least TLS version 1.2. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `script` | `string` | `` | A script to use for the target operator. It has precedence over the 'command' field. |
| `args_mapping` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of values matching in size to the number of arguments required for the specified Redis script. |
| `keys_mapping` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of keys matching in size to the number of arguments required for the specified Redis script. |
| `retries` | `int` | `3` | The maximum number of retries before abandoning a request. |
| `retry_period` | `string` | `"500ms"` | The time to wait before consecutive retry attempts. |
