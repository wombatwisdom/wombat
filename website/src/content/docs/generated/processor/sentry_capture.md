Captures log events from messages and submits them to https://sentry.io/[Sentry^].

Introduced in version 4.16.0.





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `dsn` | `string` | `""` | The DSN address to send sentry events to. If left empty, then SENTRY_DSN is used. |
| `message` | `string` | `` | A message to set on the sentry event |
| `context` | `string` | `` | A mapping that must evaluate to an object-of-objects or `deleted()`. If this mapping produces a value, then it is set on a sentry event as additional context. |
| `tags` | `object` | `` | Sets key/value string tags on an event. Unlike context, these are indexed and searchable on Sentry but have length limitations. |
| `environment` | `string` | `""` | The environment to be sent with events. If left empty, then SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT is used. |
| `release` | `string` | `""` | The version of the code deployed to an environment. If left empty, then the Sentry client will attempt to detect the release from the environment. |
| `level` | `string` | `"INFO"` | Sets the level on sentry events similar to logging levels. |
| `transport_mode` | `string` | `"async"` | Determines how events are sent. A sync transport will block when sending each event until a response is received from the Sentry server. The recommended async transport will enqueue events in a buffer and send them in the background. |
| `flush_timeout` | `string` | `"5s"` | The duration to wait when closing the processor to flush any remaining enqueued events. |
| `sampling_rate` | `float` | `1` | The rate at which events are sent to the server. A value of 0 disables capturing sentry events entirely. A value of 1 results in sending all events to Sentry. Any value in between results sending some percentage of events. |
