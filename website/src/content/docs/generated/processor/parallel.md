A processor that applies a list of child processors to messages of a batch as though they were each a batch of one message (similar to the xref:components:processors/for_each.adoc[`for_each`] processor), but where each message is processed in parallel.


The field `cap`, if greater than zero, caps the maximum number of parallel processing threads.

The functionality of this processor depends on being applied across messages that are batched. You can find out more about batching in xref:configuration:batching.adoc[].

|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `cap` | `int` | `0` | The maximum number of messages to have processing at a given time. |
| `processors` | `array` | `` | A list of child processors to apply. |
