Breaks message batches (synonymous with multiple part messages) into smaller batches. The size of the resulting batches are determined either by a discrete size or, if the field `byte_size` is non-zero, then by total size in bytes (which ever limit is reached first).


This processor is for breaking batches down into smaller ones. In order to break a single message out into multiple messages use the xref:components:processors/unarchive.adoc[`unarchive` processor].

If there is a remainder of messages after splitting a batch the remainder is also sent as a single batch. For example, if your target size was 10, and the processor received a batch of 95 message parts, the result would be 9 batches of 10 messages followed by a batch of 5 messages.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `size` | `int` | `1` | The target number of messages. |
| `byte_size` | `int` | `0` | An optional target of total message bytes. |
