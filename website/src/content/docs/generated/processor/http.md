Performs an HTTP request using a message batch as the request body, and replaces the original message parts with the body of the response.


The `rate_limit` field can be used to specify a rate limit xref:components:rate_limits/about.adoc[resource] to cap the rate of requests across all parallel components service wide.

The URL and header values of this type can be dynamically set using function interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here].

In order to map or encode the payload to a specific request body, and map the response back into the original payload instead of replacing it entirely, you can use the xref:components:processors/branch.adoc[`branch` processor].

## Response codes

Redpanda Connect considers any response code between 200 and 299 inclusive to indicate a successful response, you can add more success status codes with the field `successful_on`.

When a request returns a response code within the `backoff_on` field it will be retried after increasing intervals.

When a request returns a response code within the `drop_on` field it will not be reattempted and is immediately considered a failed request.

## Add metadata

If the request returns an error response code this processor sets a metadata field `http_status_code` on the resulting message.

Use the field `extract_headers` to specify rules for which other headers should be copied into the resulting message from the response.

## Error handling

When all retry attempts for a message are exhausted the processor cancels the attempt. These failed messages will continue through the pipeline unchanged, but can be dropped or placed in a dead letter queue according to your config, you can read about xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[these patterns].


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	This example uses a xref:components:processors/branch.adoc[`branch` processor] to strip the request message into an empty body, grab an HTTP payload, and place the result back into the original message at the path `repo.status`:
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
pipeline:
  processors:
    - branch:
        request_map: 'root = ""'
        processors:
          - http:
              url: https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/jeffail/benthos
              verb: GET
              headers:
                Content-Type: application/json
        result_map: 'root.repo.status = this'
