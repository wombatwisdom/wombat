Automatically decodes and validates messages with schemas from a Confluent Schema Registry service.


Decodes messages automatically from a schema stored within a https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html[Confluent Schema Registry service^] by extracting a schema ID from the message and obtaining the associated schema from the registry. If a message fails to match against the schema then it will remain unchanged and the error can be caught using xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[error handling methods].

Avro, Protobuf and Json schemas are supported, all are capable of expanding from schema references as of v4.22.0.

## Avro JSON format

This processor creates documents formatted as https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding[Avro JSON^] when decoding with Avro schemas. In this format the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- if its type is `null`, then it is encoded as a JSON `null`;
- otherwise it is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair whose name is the type's name and whose value is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum) the user-specified name is used, for other types the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Foo"]`, where `Foo` is a record name, would encode:

- `null` as `null`;
- the string `"a"` as `\{"string": "a"}`; and
- a `Foo` instance as `\{"Foo": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Foo` instance.

However, it is possible to instead create documents in https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard/raw JSON format^] by setting the field <<avro_raw_json, `avro_raw_json`>> to `true`.

## Protobuf format

This processor decodes protobuf messages to JSON documents, you can read more about JSON mapping of protobuf messages here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `avro_raw_json` | `bool` | `false` | Whether Avro messages should be decoded into normal JSON ("json that meets the expectations of regular internet json") rather than https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding[Avro JSON^]. If `true` the schema returned from the subject should be decoded as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard json^] instead of as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodec[avro json^]. There is a https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/blob/5ec5a5ee7ec82e16e6e2b438d610e1cab2588393/union.go#L224-L249[comment in goavro^], the https://github.com/linkedin/goavro[underlining library used for avro serialization^], that explains in more detail the difference between the standard json and avro json. |
| `url` | `string` | `` | The base URL of the schema registry service. |
| `oauth` | `object` | `` | Allows you to specify open authentication via OAuth version 1. |
| `oauth.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use OAuth version 1 in requests. |
| `oauth.consumer_key` | `string` | `""` | A value used to identify the client to the service provider. |
| `oauth.consumer_secret` | `string` | `""` | A secret used to establish ownership of the consumer key. |
| `oauth.access_token` | `string` | `""` | A value used to gain access to the protected resources on behalf of the user. |
| `oauth.access_token_secret` | `string` | `""` | A secret provided in order to establish ownership of a given access token. |
| `basic_auth` | `object` | `` | Allows you to specify basic authentication. |
| `basic_auth.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use basic authentication in requests. |
| `basic_auth.username` | `string` | `""` | A username to authenticate as. |
| `basic_auth.password` | `string` | `""` | A password to authenticate with. |
| `jwt` | `object` | `` | BETA: Allows you to specify JWT authentication. |
| `jwt.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use JWT authentication in requests. |
| `jwt.private_key_file` | `string` | `""` | A file with the PEM encoded via PKCS1 or PKCS8 as private key. |
| `jwt.signing_method` | `string` | `""` | A method used to sign the token such as RS256, RS384, RS512 or EdDSA. |
| `jwt.claims` | `object` | `{}` | A value used to identify the claims that issued the JWT. |
| `jwt.headers` | `object` | `{}` | Add optional key/value headers to the JWT. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
