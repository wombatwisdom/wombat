Runs an arbitrary SQL query against a database and (optionally) returns the result as an array of objects, one for each row returned.

Introduced in version 3.65.0.


If the query fails to execute then the message will remain unchanged and the error can be caught using xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[error handling methods].

## Alternatives

For basic inserts or select queries use either the xref:components:processors/sql_insert.adoc[`sql_insert`] or the xref:components:processors/sql_select.adoc[`sql_select`] processor. For more complex queries use the xref:components:processors/sql_raw.adoc[`sql_raw`] processor.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `driver` | `string` | `` | A database <<drivers, driver>> to use. |
| `data_source_name` | `string` | `` | Data source name. |
| `query` | `string` | `` | The query to execute. The style of placeholder to use depends on the driver, some drivers require question marks (`?`) whereas others expect incrementing dollar signs (`$1`, `$2`, and so on) or colons (`:1`, `:2` and so on). The style to use is outlined in this table:

| Driver | Placeholder Style |
|---|---|
| `clickhouse` | Dollar sign |
| `mysql` | Question mark |
| `postgres` | Dollar sign |
| `mssql` | Question mark |
| `sqlite` | Question mark |
| `oracle` | Colon |
| `snowflake` | Question mark |
| `trino` | Question mark |
| `gocosmos` | Colon | |
| `unsafe_dynamic_query` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to enable xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions] in the query. Great care should be made to ensure your queries are defended against injection attacks. |
| `args_mapping` | `string` | `` | An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of values matching in size to the number of placeholder arguments in the field `query`. |
| `result_codec` | `string` | `"none"` | Result codec. |
