\{\{style="warning"\}\}
Creates or updates messages as JSON documents in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction[Azure CosmosDB^].

Introduced in version v4.25.0.


When creating documents, each message must have the `id` property (case-sensitive) set (or use `auto_id: true`). It is the unique name that identifies the document, that is, no two documents share the same `id` within a logical partition. The `id` field must not exceed 255 characters. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/documents[See details^].

The `partition_keys` field must resolve to the same value(s) across the entire message batch.


## Credentials

You can use one of the following authentication mechanisms:

- Set the `endpoint` field and the `account_key` field
- Set only the `endpoint` field to use https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential[DefaultAzureCredential^]
- Set the `connection_string` field


## Metadata

This component adds the following metadata fields to each message:
```
- activity_id
- request_charge
```

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].


## Batching

CosmosDB limits the maximum batch size to 100 messages and the payload must not exceed 2MB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits#per-request-limits[details here^]).

## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `endpoint` | `string` | `` | CosmosDB endpoint. |
| `account_key` | `string` | `` | Account key. |
| `connection_string` | `string` | `` | Connection string. |
| `database` | `string` | `` | Database. |
| `container` | `string` | `` | Container. |
| `partition_keys_map` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to a single partition key value or an array of partition key values of type string, integer or boolean. Currently, hierarchical partition keys are not supported so only one value may be provided. |
| `operation` | `string` | `"Create"` | Operation. |
| `patch_operations` | `array` | `` | Patch operations to be performed when `operation: Patch` . |
| `patch_operations[].operation` | `string` | `"Add"` | Operation. |
| `patch_operations[].path` | `string` | `` | Path. |
| `patch_operations[].value_map` | `string` | `` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to a value of any type that is supported by CosmosDB. |
| `patch_condition` | `string` | `` | Patch operation condition. |
| `auto_id` | `bool` | `true` | Automatically set the item `id` field to a random UUID v4. If the `id` field is already set, then it will not be overwritten. Setting this to `false` can improve performance, since the messages will not have to be parsed. |
| `item_id` | `string` | `` | ID of item to replace or delete. Only used by the Replace and Delete operations |
| `enable_content_response_on_write` | `bool` | `true` | Enable content response on write operations. To save some bandwidth, set this to false if you don't need to receive the updated message(s) from the server, in which case the processor will not modify the content of the messages which are fed into it. Applies to every operation except Read. |


== CosmosDB emulator

If you wish to run the CosmosDB emulator that is referenced in the documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/linux-emulator[here^], the following Docker command should do the trick:

```bash
> docker run --rm -it -p 8081:8081 --name=cosmosdb -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT=10 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_ENABLE_DATA_PERSISTENCE=false mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator
```

Note: `AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT` controls the number of partitions that will be supported by the emulator. The bigger the value, the longer it takes for the container to start up.

Additionally, instead of installing the container self-signed certificate which is exposed via `https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem`, you can run https://mitmproxy.org/[mitmproxy^] like so:

```bash
> mitmproxy -k --mode "reverse:https://localhost:8081"
```

Then you can access the CosmosDB UI via `http://localhost:8080/_explorer/index.html` and use `http://localhost:8080` as the CosmosDB endpoint.
