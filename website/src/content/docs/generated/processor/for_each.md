A processor that applies a list of child processors to messages of a batch as though they were each a batch of one message.


This is useful for forcing batch wide processors such as xref:components:processors/dedupe.adoc[`dedupe`] or interpolations such as the `value` field of the `metadata` processor to execute on individual message parts of a batch instead.

Please note that most processors already process per message of a batch, and this processor is not needed in those cases.
