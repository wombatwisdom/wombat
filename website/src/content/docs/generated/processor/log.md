Prints a log event for each message. Messages always remain unchanged. The log message can be set using function interpolations described in  xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[Bloblang queries] which allows you to log the contents and metadata of messages.


The `level` field determines the log level of the printed events and can be any of the following values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.

## Structured fields

It's also possible add custom fields to logs when the format is set to a structured form such as `json` or `logfmt` with the config field <<fields_mapping, `fields_mapping`>>:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - log:
        level: DEBUG
        message: hello world
        fields_mapping: |
          root.reason = "cus I wana"
          root.id = this.id
          root.age = this.user.age
          root.kafka_topic = meta("kafka_topic")
```





## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `level` | `string` | `"INFO"` | The log level to use. |
| `fields_mapping` | `string` | `` | An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] that can be used to specify extra fields to add to the log. If log fields are also added with the `fields` field then those values will override matching keys from this mapping. |
| `message` | `string` | `""` | The message to print. |
