Executes a PartiQL expression against a DynamoDB table for each message.

Introduced in version 3.48.0.


Both writes or reads are supported, when the query is a read the contents of the message will be replaced with the result. This processor is more efficient when messages are pre-batched as the whole batch will be executed in a single call.


## Examples

<tab title="Example 0">
	The following example inserts rows into the table footable with the columns foo, bar and baz populated with values extracted from messages:
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		
pipeline:
  processors:
    - aws_dynamodb_partiql:
        query: "INSERT INTO footable VALUE {'foo':'?','bar':'?','baz':'?'}"
        args_mapping: |
          root = [
            { "S": this.foo },
            { "S": meta("kafka_topic") },
            { "S": this.document.content },
          ]
