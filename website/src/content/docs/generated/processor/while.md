A processor that checks a xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] against each batch of messages and executes child processors on them for as long as the query resolves to true.


The field `at_least_once`, if true, ensures that the child processors are always executed at least one time (like a do .. while loop.)

The field `max_loops`, if greater than zero, caps the number of loops for a message batch to this value.

If following a loop execution the number of messages in a batch is reduced to zero the loop is exited regardless of the condition result. If following a loop execution there are more than 1 message batches the query is checked against the first batch only.

The conditions of this processor are applied across entire message batches. You can find out more about batching xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `at_least_once` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to always run the child processors at least one time. |
| `max_loops` | `int` | `0` | An optional maximum number of loops to execute. Helps protect against accidentally creating infinite loops. |
| `check` | `string` | `""` | A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether the while loop should execute again. |
| `processors` | `array` | `` | A list of child processors to execute on each loop. |
