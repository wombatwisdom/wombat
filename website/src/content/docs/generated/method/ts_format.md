Attempts to format a timestamp value as a string according to a specified format, or RFC 3339 by default. Timestamp values can either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in RFC 3339 format.

The output format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006, would be displayed if it were the value. For an alternative way to specify formats check out the <<ts_strftime, `ts_strftime`>> method.
