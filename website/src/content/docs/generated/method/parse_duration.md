Attempts to parse a string as a duration and returns an integer of nanoseconds. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with an optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
