Modifies a target query such that certain functions are executed from the perspective of each message in the batch, and returns the set of results as an array. Functions that support this behavior are `content`, `json` and `meta`.


## Examples
<tabs>
<tab title="Example 0">
	
	<code-block lang="yaml">
		root = this
root.foo_summed = json("foo").from_all().sum()
	</code-block>
</tab>

</tabs>
