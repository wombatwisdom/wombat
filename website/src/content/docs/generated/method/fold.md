Takes two arguments: an initial value, and a mapping query. For each element of an array the mapping context is an object with two fields `tally` and `value`, where `tally` contains the current accumulated value and `value` is the value of the current element. The mapping must return the result of adding the value to the tally.

The first argument is the value that `tally` will have on the first call.
