Converts a numerical type into a 64-bit floating point number, this is for advanced use cases where a specific data type is needed for a given component (such as the ClickHouse SQL driver).

If the value is a string then an attempt will be made to parse it as a 64-bit floating point number. Please refer to the https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseFloat[`strconv.ParseFloat` documentation] for details regarding the supported formats.
