Attempts to parse a string as an XML document and returns a structured result, where elements appear as keys of an object according to the following rules:

- If an element contains attributes they are parsed by prefixing a hyphen, `-`, to the attribute label.
- If the element is a simple element and has attributes, the element value is given the key `#text`.
- XML comments, directives, and process instructions are ignored.
- When elements are repeated the resulting JSON value is an array.
- If cast is true, try to cast values to numbers and booleans instead of returning strings.
