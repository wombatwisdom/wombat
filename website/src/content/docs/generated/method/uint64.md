Converts a numerical type into a 64-bit unsigned integer, this is for advanced use cases where a specific data type is needed for a given component (such as the ClickHouse SQL driver).

If the value is a string then an attempt will be made to parse it as a 64-bit unsigned integer. If the target value exceeds the capacity of an integer or contains decimal values then this method will throw an error. In order to convert a floating point number containing decimals first use <<round, `.round()`>> on the value. Please refer to the https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseInt[`strconv.ParseInt` documentation] for details regarding the supported formats.
