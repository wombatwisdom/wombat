Attempts to parse a string as a timestamp following a specified format and outputs a timestamp, which can then be fed into methods such as <<ts_format, `ts_format`>>.

The input format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006, would be displayed if it were the value. For an alternative way to specify formats check out the <<ts_strptime, `ts_strptime`>> method.
