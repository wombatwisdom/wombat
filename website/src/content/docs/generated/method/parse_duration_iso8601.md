Attempts to parse a string using ISO-8601 rules as a duration and returns an integer of nanoseconds. A duration string is represented by the format "P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S" or "P[n]W". In these representations, the "[n]" is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the "[n]". For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds". The last field of the format allows fractions with one decimal place, so "P3.5S" will return 3500000000ns. Any additional decimals will be truncated.
