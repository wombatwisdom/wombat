Merge a source object into an existing destination object. When a collision is found within the merged structures (both a source and destination object contain the same non-object keys) the result will be an array containing both values, where values that are already arrays will be expanded into the resulting array. In order to simply override destination fields on collision use the <<assign, `assign`>> method.
