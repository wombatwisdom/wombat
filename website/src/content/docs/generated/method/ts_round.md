Introduced in version 4.2.0.


Returns the result of rounding a timestamp to the nearest multiple of the argument duration (nanoseconds). The rounding behavior for halfway values is to round up. Timestamp values can either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in RFC 3339 format. The <<ts_parse, `ts_parse`>> method can be used in order to parse different timestamp formats.
