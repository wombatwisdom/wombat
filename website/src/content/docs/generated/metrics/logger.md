Prints aggregated metrics through the logger.


Prints each metric produced by Redpanda Connect as a log event (level `info` by default) during shutdown, and optionally on an interval.

This metrics type is useful for debugging pipelines when you only have access to the logger output and not the service-wide server. Otherwise it's recommended that you use either the `prometheus` or `json_api`types.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `push_interval` | `string` | `` | An optional period of time to continuously print all metrics. |
| `flush_metrics` | `bool` | `false` | Whether counters and timing metrics should be reset to 0 each time metrics are printed. |
