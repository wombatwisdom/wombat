Send metrics to InfluxDB 1.x using the `/write` endpoint.

Introduced in version 3.36.0.


See https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/tools/api/#write-http-endpoint for further details on the write API.




## Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:------|:---------|:-------------|
| `url` | `string` | `` | A URL of the format `[https|http|udp]://host:port` to the InfluxDB host. |
| `db` | `string` | `` | The name of the database to use. |
| `tls` | `object` | `` | Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults. |
| `tls.enabled` | `bool` | `false` | Whether custom TLS settings are enabled. |
| `tls.skip_cert_verify` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to skip server side certificate verification. |
| `tls.enable_renegotiation` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`. |
| `tls.root_cas` | `string` | `""` | An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.root_cas_file` | `string` | `""` | An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. |
| `tls.client_certs` | `array` | `[]` | A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key` | `string` | `""` | A plain text certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].cert_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].key_file` | `string` | `""` | The path of a certificate key to use. |
| `tls.client_certs[].password` | `string` | `""` | A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext. |
| `username` | `string` | `""` | A username (when applicable). |
| `password` | `string` | `""` | A password (when applicable). |
| `include` | `object` | `` | Optional additional metrics to collect, enabling these metrics may have some performance implications as it acquires a global semaphore and does `stoptheworld()`. |
| `include.runtime` | `string` | `""` | A duration string indicating how often to poll and collect runtime metrics. Leave empty to disable this metric |
| `include.debug_gc` | `string` | `""` | A duration string indicating how often to poll and collect GC metrics. Leave empty to disable this metric. |
| `interval` | `string` | `"1m"` | A duration string indicating how often metrics should be flushed. |
| `ping_interval` | `string` | `"20s"` | A duration string indicating how often to ping the host. |
| `precision` | `string` | `"s"` | [ns|us|ms|s] timestamp precision passed to write api. |
| `timeout` | `string` | `"5s"` | How long to wait for response for both ping and writing metrics. |
| `tags` | `object` | `{}` | Global tags added to each metric. |
| `retention_policy` | `string` | `` | Sets the retention policy for each write. |
| `write_consistency` | `string` | `` | [any|one|quorum|all] sets write consistency when available. |
